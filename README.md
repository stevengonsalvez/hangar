A terminal-native ecosystem for managing AI coding agents. Built around a Rust TUI that orchestrates Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and Copilot sessions with git worktree isolation, and a portable toolkit of skills, agents, and workflows that plug into 9 different AI coding tools.

### Related repositories

The portable skills, the `bootstrap.js` installer, and the catalog live in a
separate, standalone repo — `ainb` consumes it as a pinned external source.

| Repo | What it holds |
|---|---|
| **stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box** (this repo) | The `ainb` TUI/CLI unit manager (Rust workspace), the v2 plugin system, and the docs. |
| **[stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory)** | `reflect` — the long-term memory engine (GraphRAG + QMD) + its Claude Code plugin, extracted from this monorepo. Engine install: `uv tool install --upgrade 'git+https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory.git[graph]'`. |
| **[stevengonsalvez/ainb-toolkit](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-toolkit)** | The canonical home for the 94 curated skills, 16 agents, workflows, utilities, the `external-dependencies.yaml` manifest, the `bootstrap.js` legacy installer, and the generated `catalog.yaml`. `ainb` browses + installs from it; the release CI pins a tag of it to generate the curated `catalog-index.json`. |

## Why agents-in-a-box?

> ### Run a fleet. Lose nothing.
>
> Every agent gets its own worktree, its own tmux session, and a line item on your bill.

One agent is a chat window. Five agents is an operations problem, and that is the
part nothing else solves. Here is every part of it.

### Your agents stop fighting each other

| The problem | Without ainb | With ainb |
|---|---|---|
| Two agents, one branch | Index lock races, half-committed files, work silently overwritten | One git worktree and one branch per session, cleaned up when the session is killed cleanly |
| Laptop sleeps, SSH drops | Session gone, context gone, start the conversation again | tmux-backed. Reattach and keep typing where you left off |
| A crash leaves sessions behind | Hunt through `tmux ls` and guess which pane was what | `ainb recover` finds the orphans and resumes them |

### You stop babysitting them

| The problem | Without ainb | With ainb |
|---|---|---|
| Which agent needs me *right now* | Cycle through every pane in turn, repeatedly | Press `f`. The Fleet panel lists exactly who is blocked |
| An agent asked a question 20 minutes ago | Scroll back through output to find it | Answer it from the Fleet panel without attaching |
| Nobody is watching while you are away | You are the event loop | ATC wakes on a timer and works the queue for you |

### Work queues up without you

| The problem | Without ainb | With ainb |
|---|---|---|
| Every task starts with you typing | You are the scheduler | Hangar boards hold tasks agents pull from |
| One agent per job, in sequence | Long jobs serialise behind you | Squads fan a job out across several agents |
| Recurring work | A cron job you maintain by hand | Autopilots fire on a schedule and report back |

### You see what they actually changed

| The problem | Without ainb | With ainb |
|---|---|---|
| Approving diffs on autopilot | Side effects land that you never read | Hunk-by-hunk review with syntax highlighting before you trust it |
| Reviewing means opening the whole TUI | Context switch just to read a diff | `ainb diff-review` runs headless and emits JSON |

### The bill stops surprising you

| The problem | Without ainb | With ainb |
|---|---|---|
| Spend is invisible until the invoice | The provider console shows one total | Burndown by day, week, project, model and provider |
| Which repo burned the budget? | No per-repo or per-branch split anywhere | Per-project attribution, down to the worktree |
| Long runs blow the context window | The conversation resets and you start over | Headroom compresses context across opted-in sessions |

### You stop repeating yourself

| The problem | Without ainb | With ainb |
|---|---|---|
| Re-explaining the codebase every session | Every session starts cold | Learnings captured as you work, searchable next time |
| The same rule copied into four tools' configs | One copy gets updated, the rest quietly go stale | Write a skill once, deploy it to 9 tools from one source |

### The plumbing stops leaking

| The problem | Without ainb | With ainb |
|---|---|---|
| One MCP server per session | N processes, N startups, N times the memory | One pooled server shared across every session |
| Approvals and errors scattered across panes | You miss the one that mattered | One Inbox collects every notification from every agent |
| Background processes die quietly | `ps aux`, grep, guess, restart by hand | The Daemons screen shows health and restarts in place |

### It reaches further than your terminal

| The problem | Without ainb | With ainb |
|---|---|---|
| You are away from your desk | Agents stall until you get back | Bridge the fleet to Telegram, Slack or Discord |
| You want a glance without a terminal | Terminal or nothing | `ainb web` serves a read-only dashboard |
| What did that process actually touch? | Guesswork | `witr` traces process causality |
| Which agent is genuinely busy? | Open every pane and look | `abtop`, which is top for AI agents |

### What it won't do

Straight answers, so you find out here rather than twenty minutes in:

- **Worktrees isolate git state, not your environment.** Two agents still share port 3000, your database, and `node_modules`. If they need different services running, you still have to arrange that.
- **tmux is required**, not optional. Same for `git`.
- **No native Windows.** It uses PTY and POSIX file modes. WSL2 works.
- **`ainb otel` is a setup wizard for Grafana Alloy**, wiring up Claude Code's own telemetry. ainb does not emit telemetry of its own.
- **Memory starts empty.** The learnings browser is only as useful as what `reflect` has written into it.
- **ATC and headroom are opt-in** and need extra setup: a hook plugin and an external binary respectively.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the TUI (macOS / Linux)
brew tap stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box && brew install ainb
# newer Homebrew gates third-party taps — if it says "untrusted tap", run:
#   brew trust stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box

# Launch the TUI
ainb

# Register the toolkit as a source, then install the units you want into your
# real tool homes. Install is purely ADDITIVE — units land alongside your
# existing config; your CLAUDE.md, settings, projects/ history and custom
# agents are never touched.
ainb source add gh:stevengonsalvez/ainb-toolkit
AINB_USE_REAL_HOMES=1 ainb skill install gh:stevengonsalvez/ainb-toolkit/skills/commit
```

> **The easy way:** just run `ainb`, press `m` for the Skill Manager, and
> browse + install units with `[i]`. If you already have skills on disk
> (`~/.claude/skills/`, etc.), the first open offers one-keystroke adoption —
> no manual setup. `ainb skill sync` then keeps installed units reconciled with
> the manifest.
>
> To uninstall a unit, run `ainb skill remove <uri>` or press `[r]` on it in the
> Skill Manager. Removal is **per-file and scoped to that unit** — it deletes
> only what ainb deployed and can never wipe your config or session history.

---

## ainb — Terminal UI + CLI

A Rust-based terminal application for managing AI coding sessions with git worktree isolation, model selection, and persistent tmux sessions. Every operation is **available as both an interactive TUI view and a scriptable CLI subcommand** with JSON output — so humans drive it from a dashboard and agents drive it from shell scripts.

### Feature Highlights

- **Multi-provider** — Run Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, or GitHub Copilot in the same workflow, with Sonnet / Opus / Haiku selection per session
- **Git worktree isolation** — Each session runs in its own branch and working directory. No cross-contamination, no stash dance
- **tmux persistence** — Sessions survive terminal disconnects, SSH drops, and laptop sleep. Reattach any time
- **Usage analytics** — Built-in token + session tracking by day, week, provider, and project. Know where your budget went — then cut it with [The Token Optimisation Playbook](https://stevengonsalvez.com/blog/token-optimisation-playbook)
- **Easy onboarding** — First-run setup wizard checks dependencies, configures auth, and gets you creating sessions in minutes
- **Live log streaming** — Real-time viewer with level filtering and search across all running sessions
- **Scriptable CLI**: 41 commands (every TUI action, plus headless `witr`, `learnings search`, `diff-review --format json`, …), with `--format json` on session state, config, git, usage, fleet, and most daemons. **[📘 Full CLI reference →](man/cli.md)**, a generated, multi-hierarchy man page covering every subcommand.

### CLI — Scriptable Equivalent of Every TUI Feature

For agents, automation, and scripts, `ainb` ships a full CLI. Every command supports `--format json` for piping to `jq`.

```bash
ainb --help                             # Top-level overview
ainb run --repo . --worktree --tool claude --model sonnet
ainb list --format json | jq .
ainb logs my-session --follow
ainb recover list                       # Find orphaned sessions
ainb config set authentication.default_model opus
ainb completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_ainb
```

**41 top-level commands** — `tui`, `run`, `list`, `label`, `logs`, `attach`, `status`, `kill`, `auth`, `recover`, `config`, `git`, `favorites`, `init`, `doctor`, `reflect`, `presets`, `usage`, `statusline`, `claudecode`, `codex`, `tmux`, `otel`, `completion`, `abtop`, `web`, `witr`, `learnings`, `plugin`, `fleet`, `headroom`, `daemon`, `mcp`, `notifyd`, `hangar`, `rtk`, `update`, `diff-review`, `skill`, `source`, `search` — with nested subcommands for recover / config / git / favorites / presets / plugin / fleet / hangar / mcp / daemon / usage / skill / source.

**[📘 Full CLI reference → docs/tui/cli.md](man/cli.md)**

### Installation

**Recommended — Homebrew (macOS / Linux):**

```bash
brew tap stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box
brew install ainb
```

> Newer Homebrew versions refuse formulas from untrusted third-party taps. If
> `brew install`/`brew upgrade` errors with *"Refusing to load formula … from
> untrusted tap"*, trust the tap once and retry:
> `brew trust stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box`

The tap lives at [`stevengonsalvez/homebrew-agents-in-a-box`](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/homebrew-agents-in-a-box) and is auto-updated by the release workflow on every tagged release — `brew upgrade ainb` always pulls the latest.

### Updates

ainb installs a short-lived daily OS timer on first TUI launch. The timer checks
the latest signed stable release even while ainb is closed, then records the
result and sends one native notification per version. It never installs a
release without an explicit command.

```bash
ainb update check             # verify signed release metadata now
ainb update status            # show cached result
ainb update --yes             # install latest signed stable release
ainb update schedule status   # inspect daily checker
ainb update schedule disable  # opt out of background checks
```

The Daemons screen lists this as `release checker`. Homebrew updates through
`brew upgrade ainb`; Cargo updates from the exact signed release tag; curl
installs download, checksum, stage, and atomically replace only canonical
ainb install paths.

<details>

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevengonsalvez/hangar/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Cargo** (any platform with a Rust toolchain):
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box --branch main ainb
```

**Windows via WSL2** — native Windows is not supported (`ainb` uses Unix-only APIs: PTY, POSIX file modes). Use WSL2:
```powershell
wsl --install                                                                         # 1. Install WSL2
# Inside Ubuntu/Debian:
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevengonsalvez/hangar/main/install.sh | bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y tmux
ainb
```

<summary><b>Troubleshooting Homebrew</b></summary>

**`Error: Your Command Line Tools are too outdated`** — this is a Homebrew check on the standalone `CommandLineTools` package, separate from a full Xcode install. If you have a recent Xcode but an old standalone CLT, brew picks the older one. Reinstall the CLT:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
sudo xcode-select --install
```

**`Formulae found in multiple taps`** — if you previously tapped a similarly-named bucket, untap it:
```bash
brew untap stevengonsalvez/ainb   # only if you tapped this earlier
brew install stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box/ainb
```

**`Refusing to load formula … from untrusted tap`** — newer Homebrew gates third-party taps behind an explicit trust step. Trust the tap once and retry:
```bash
brew trust stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box
brew install ainb   # or brew upgrade ainb
```
</details>

### Plugins

`ainb` boots a plugin host at startup. Some screens — notably **Analytics / Usage (the burndown dashboard)** — are provided by subprocess plugins that the host discovers and loads automatically. **All plugins are enabled by default**; you only need the controls below to turn them off or scope which ones load.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box/v2/docs/assets/diagrams/plugin-architecture.svg" alt="ainb v2 plugin architecture: the host and its runtime, the JSON-RPC method sets on each side of the wire, the six in-tree plugins, and the two ways a plugin can draw" width="860">
</p>

**How it works (in brief):** a v2 plugin is a **native subprocess** that speaks **JSON-RPC 2.0 over Content-Length-framed stdio**, no wasm, no in-process linking. The host (`ainb-core`) discovers each plugin from `dist/plugins/<id>/`, spawns it, and exchanges messages: `plugin/render` (the plugin returns a `WireBuffer` of cells the host blits), `plugin/handle_key`, `plugin/cli_dispatch` (routes `ainb <namespace> …`), plus reverse `host/snapshot/publish` calls over an **event bus**. Each plugin declares its `[capabilities]` in `manifest.toml`; the runtime denies any ungranted host call with JSON-RPC `-32001`. A plugin screen can render **two ways**: in-process via a `WireBuffer` (host owns the terminal, e.g. **burndown**), or as a **host-embedded foreign TTY** where ainb suspends and hands the terminal to an external interactive program (e.g. **witr**'s `witr -i` browser). Full walkthrough: [`docs/plugins/`](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box/blob/v2/docs/plugins/overview.md).

There are four ways to filter plugins, with the following precedence (most specific wins):

| Goal | How | Type |
|------|-----|------|
| All on (default) | *(nothing)* | — |
| All off (kill switch) | `AINB_DISABLE_PLUGINS=1 ainb` | env |
| Load only these | `AINB_ONLY_PLUGINS=burndown ainb` | env allowlist |
| Load all except these | `AINB_DISABLE_PLUGIN=burndown ainb` | env denylist |
| Persistent allowlist | `[plugins].enabled = ["burndown"]` in `config.toml` | config |
| Persistent denylist | `[plugins].disabled = ["burndown"]` in `config.toml` | config |

Resolution order: `AINB_DISABLE_PLUGINS` → `AINB_ONLY_PLUGINS` → `AINB_DISABLE_PLUGIN` → config `enabled` → config `disabled` → default all-on. **Env always beats config**, and an allowlist always beats a denylist.

Config lives at `~/.agents-in-a-box/config/config.toml` under a `[plugins]` table, see [`example.config.toml`](config/example.config.toml) for the annotated block. When a screen's plugin is disabled, the TUI shows a placeholder naming the exact variable that turned it off, rather than hanging.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j/k` or `↑/↓` | Navigate sessions |
| `Enter` | Attach to session |
| `n` | New session |
| `d` | Delete session |
| `r` | Restart Claude in session |
| `l` | View logs |
| `q` | Quit |

### Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Method |
|----------|--------|--------|
| macOS Apple Silicon | ✅ | Pre-built binary |
| macOS Intel | ✅ | Build from source |
| Linux x86_64 | ✅ | Pre-built binary |
| Linux ARM64 | ✅ | Build from source |
| Windows (WSL2) | ✅ | Install script |
| Windows (Native) | ❌ | Unsupported — uses Unix-only APIs (PTY, POSIX) |

### Requirements

- **tmux** — persistent session management
- **git** — worktree operations
- **Claude Code CLI** — the `claude` command

### Live window source matrix

| Provider | 5h burn | 7d window | Cost | Reset times | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code (Pro/Max OAuth + statusline wired) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | OAuth-grade via Claude Code |
| Claude Code (API key) | ✓ | — | ✓ | — | local JSONL fallback |
| Claude Code (statusline not wired) | ✓ | — | ✓ | — | local JSONL fallback |
| Codex | ✓ | — | ✓ | — | local JSONL fallback |
| Other agents | — | — | — | — | not supported |

**Why the asymmetry**: only Anthropic publishes rate-limit windows over OAuth, and only the Claude Code CLI exposes them to statusline hooks. Wiring `ainb claudecode statusline` brings the OAuth-grade signal into the TUI's Burndown panel and session-window top bar.

## Knowledge System

A two-tier learning system that captures insights during development and retrieves them across sessions and projects.

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Fast local** | QMD (Quick Markdown Documents) | Semantic search over structured learning notes |
| **Deep graph** | GraphRAG (nano-graphrag) | Entity-relationship graph with community detection for cross-project knowledge retrieval |

The `/reflect` skill captures learnings. The `/research` and `/prime` skills retrieve them. The [`reflect`](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory) Python library (installed as the `reflect` CLI) manages the knowledge base directly — it lives in its own repo, [stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory), and installs via `uv tool install --upgrade 'git+https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory.git[graph]'`.

The documentation hub, the website, the research notes and the other harness
plugins are not in this repository yet: they are in its history and still live
in `stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box`. See [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md).

The `reflect` CLI (the GraphRAG/QMD engine and its Claude Code plugin) lives
in [`ainb-reflect-memory`](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory),
and the portable toolkit (94 skills, 16 agents, workflows, utilities,
`bootstrap.js`, `external-dependencies.yaml`, `catalog.yaml`) in
[`ainb-toolkit`](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-toolkit), which
`ainb` consumes as a pinned external source.

## CI/CD & Quality

| Check | Tool | What it catches |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| Format | `rustfmt` | Style inconsistencies |
| Lint | `clippy` (pedantic + nursery) | Logic errors, anti-patterns, code smells |
| Test | `cargo-nextest` (Ubuntu + macOS) | Regressions across platforms |
| Security | `cargo-deny` (RustSec) | Known vulnerabilities in dependencies |
| Licenses | `cargo-deny` | Non-compliant dependency licenses |
| Dead deps | `cargo-machete` | Unused crate declarations |
| Toolkit structure | Custom validation | Package counts, template substitution, install verification |

The Rust codebase enforces `unsafe_code = "forbid"` and runs clippy with `pedantic`, `nursery`, and `cargo` lint groups enabled.

---

## Development

### Building from source

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/ainb
```

### Running tests

```bash
cargo test                              # Unit tests
cargo test --features visual-debug      # With terminal output
cargo test --features vt100-tests       # VT100 screen verification
cargo nextest run                       # With nextest (parallel)
```

### Linting & checks

```bash
cargo fmt --check                       # Format check
cargo clippy --all-targets              # Lint
cargo deny check                        # Security + licenses
```

### Installing the toolkit

Install is **additive** — units are deployed alongside whatever is already in
your tool homes; nothing is wiped. Writes to the real tool dirs are opt-in via
`AINB_USE_REAL_HOMES=1` (without it, ainb writes to a managed sandbox).

```bash
# Register the toolkit as a source (fetches it and reports its unit count).
ainb source add gh:stevengonsalvez/ainb-toolkit

# Install the units you want into the real tool home dirs.
AINB_USE_REAL_HOMES=1 ainb skill install gh:stevengonsalvez/ainb-toolkit/skills/commit

# Scope an install to specific tools (passed to every mutating verb):
ainb skill install gh:stevengonsalvez/ainb-toolkit/skills/commit --targets claude,codex
ainb skill sync                               # reconcile installed units with the manifest
ainb skill update --check                     # report drift across sources
ainb skill update --all --yes                 # re-fetch + apply
ainb skill remove gh:stevengonsalvez/ainb-toolkit/skills/commit   # per-file uninstall, never touches config
ainb doctor                                   # health-check the deployment
```

> Prefer the TUI? Press `m` for the Skill Manager to browse + install units
> with `[i]` and remove them with `[r]` — no manual URIs.

See [the skill-manager guide](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box/blob/v2/docs/skill-manager/guide.mdx) for the full §8 CLI
surface (`source`, `skill`, `doctor`, `usage`).

#### v1.1 — Discovery + adoption + promote

If you already have skills under `~/.<tool>/skills/` (Claude,
Codex, Gemini, …) or plugins installed via Claude Code's
`/plugin install`, you don't have to migrate by hand any more.
v1.1 layers a read-only discovery walker + a one-keystroke
adoption banner on top of v1. Open SkillManager (`m` on Home)
with an empty manifest and `ainb` offers to import what's already
on disk — marketplace plugins, orphan skills, the lot —
including a conflict matrix when the same name shows up in two
places.

A new `ainb skill promote <unit> --to gh:user/repo` command turns
a hand-edited orphan into a git-backed source in one shot:
clones the target repo, copies the unit, commits + pushes, and
rewrites the manifest URI from `local:` to `gh:`.
