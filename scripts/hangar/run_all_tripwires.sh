#   crates/ainb-plugin-hangar/tests/tripwire_*.rs                   P3.8/P4.10 plugin↔daemon roundtrip
#
# Conventions (deliberately mirroring the repo, NOT the stale P9 plan):
#
#   * `set -o pipefail` so a failing test run is never masked by a
#     downstream pipe (`reference_tail_masks_pipe_exit`).
#   * ONE `cargo nextest run` per package, not one `cargo test --test X` per
#     file. The per-file loop spawned one cargo process per target (68 today),
#     each re-resolving the dependency graph, re-checking every fingerprint, and
#     relinking before running a single binary; that overhead, not the tests,
#     was most of this script's CI wall-clock. nextest takes the target list as
#     repeated `--test` flags, so the globs below still decide exactly what
#     runs.
#   * `--test-threads=1` for the whole suite: several tripwires mutate the
#     process env (`ENV_LOCK`-guarded) and bind per-test sockets; serialising
#     keeps cross-process/within-binary env races deterministic
#     (`reference_env_lock_for_parallel_tests`).
#   * The OTLP export tripwire is `#![cfg(feature = "otlp")]` — without the
#     feature its file compiles to nothing — so it runs in a SEPARATE
#     `--features otlp` invocation.
#   * Exit code = number of failed tripwire binaries. On failure the offending
#     tripwire name is printed to stderr so CI surfaces it directly.
#     CAVEAT of the one-invocation-per-package shape: a COMPILE error is a
#     property of the group, not of a target. nextest builds the whole group
#     before running anything, so one target that fails to compile costs its
#     package one counted failure and its siblings never run at all. The
#     per-file loop would have run the other 67. A compile break is loud and
#     is caught earlier by `fmt`/`test` anyway; a mid-suite runtime failure,
#     the case this gate actually exists for, still attributes per binary.
#
# PREREQUISITES (the caller stages these; CI does it as explicit steps):
#   * `cargo-nextest` on PATH. CI installs it in the `hangar-e2e` job; locally
#     `cargo install cargo-nextest`. Without it every group reports
#     `nextest exited 101 with no per-test failure (build error?)`.
#   * `cargo build -p ainb-hangar-daemon --bin ainb-hangar-daemon`
#   * `bash scripts/build-plugins.sh`  (stages dist/plugins/hangar-tui/)
# The plugin↔daemon roundtrip tripwire needs the staged plugin + daemon binary.
#
# Run from the repo root OR anywhere: the script cd's to the

# Optional SMOKE subset (the CI macOS leg). The hosted GitHub macOS runner is
# too small to finish the full serial suite (68 tripwires today) within budget:
# ~4 random heavy per-screen TUI tripwires time out at the scaled ceiling, a
# runner-capacity artifact (every tripwire passes deterministically on the Linux
# leg). The tmux tripwires exercise OS-agnostic render/protocol/daemon logic, so
# the Linux leg is the authoritative full matrix; the macOS leg only needs to
# prove the macOS-staged binaries actually LAUNCH + the basic stack works
# (daemon boots, an issue-list TUI renders, the plugin connects, the
# macOS-specific crash/reconnect path). With HANGAR_TRIPWIRE_SMOKE=1 the heavy
# per-screen daemon TUI tripwires are pruned to that subset; the fast
# store-migration and plugin-roundtrip tripwires always run on both legs.

    # NOT included: heavy per-screen render + lifecycle tripwires (autopilots,
    # create-flow, agent-picker, cross-screen, plugin-crash/reconnect, the

    # runner and flake here; the Linux leg runs them all deterministically, and

    # before it can rejoin a gating leg. The mouse-drag tripwire

    # live TUI — OS-agnostic render/protocol logic the Linux full leg authorises.
