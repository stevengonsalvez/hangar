#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Run the Hangar control-plane ACCEPTANCE tests — the framed-socket RPC,
# migration-upgrade, and CLI-surface integration tests that prove each feature
# bead end to end.
#
# Why this exists (the gate gap it closes):
#   * CI's `test` job runs `cargo nextest run --lib` — LIB unit tests only, so
#     NOTHING under `tests/` is built or run there.
#   * CI's `hangar-e2e` job runs `run_all_tripwires.sh` — `tripwire_*` only.
#   So the framed-socket + CLI acceptance proofs (rpc_event_push,
#   rpc_issue_update, rpc_comment_add, rpc_comment_mention_spawn,
#   migration_*_upgrade, hangar_cli_integration, …) were gated by NOTHING in CI
#   and only passed because they were run locally. This script gates them.
#
# Scope: every NON-`tripwire_*` integration test target in the three hangar
# crates (auto-globbed, so new acceptance tests are covered without editing this
# file), PLUS the two hangar acceptance targets in the `ainb` crate, run by
# EXPLICIT --test name — the `ainb` crate's other integration targets
# (tests/ui_tests.rs, tests/behavioral/, …) carry pre-existing `NewSessionState`
# drift that fails to compile and is unrelated to Hangar; naming the targets
# explicitly avoids building them.
#
# Shape: ONE `cargo nextest run` per package, not one `cargo test --test X` per
# file. The per-file loop spawned one cargo process per target (227 today), each
# re-resolving the dependency graph, re-checking every fingerprint, and
# relinking before running a single binary; that overhead, not the tests, was
# most of this script's CI wall-clock. nextest takes the target list as repeated
# `--test` flags, so the globs below still decide exactly what runs, including
# the `ainb` crate's explicit prefix list, which must NOT become a blanket
# `--tests`.
