# Seed an isolated ainb and open the sessions screen with agents waiting on it.
#
# The point of the attention-surface epic is that ONE screen answers "who needs
# me", so the demo has to show more than one waiting session and an answer
# actually going out. The fixture is deliberately the same shape as
# `tripwire_sessions_answer_outcome_per_question`, which drives this exact
# path in CI: what the recording shows is a path something tests.
#
# Everything lives under a throwaway $HOME, and the demo runs against its own
# PRIVATE tmux server via $TMUX_TMPDIR. That second part is not tidiness: the
# sessions screen lists every tmux session on the host it cannot account for,
# under "Other tmux", so a recording made against the shared server publishes
# the operator's real session names. A private server can only ever show the
# three this script made.
#
# Nothing touches the operator's own ~/.agents-in-a-box, and the sessions are
# killed by EXACT name on the way out.
#
# Usage (from the repo root; a debug build is enough):
#   scripts/attention-surface-demo.sh              # no daemon
#   scripts/attention-surface-demo.sh --daemon     # with a hangar daemon
#
# WITHOUT `--daemon` is the interesting default: the chips come from the local
# notifyd producer and the answer rides the tmux send path, which is the half
# that has to hold the surface up when the daemon is down. Verbs that are
# daemon-OWNED (broadcast, the copilot tab) need `--daemon`, and say so
# honestly on screen when they do not have one.
#
# The daemon is brought up under its own $AINB_HANGAR_HOME inside the same
# throwaway directory, so it never touches ~/.agents-in-a-box, and it is
# stopped by that same home on the way out.
#
# The tapes in docs/assets/screenshots/attention-*.tape drive it.
