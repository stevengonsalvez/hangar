# Generate the full multi-hierarchy CLI reference (docs/tui/cli.md) from the

# Driving the real binary (rather than the clap tree directly) means the

# Usage:
#   scripts/gen-cli-reference.sh            # builds ainb (release), regenerates
#   AINB_BIN=target/debug/ainb scripts/gen-cli-reference.sh   # reuse a built bin
#
# CI freshness gate (see .github/workflows/ci.yml):
#   AINB_BIN=target/debug/ainb scripts/gen-cli-reference.sh
#   git diff --exit-code -- docs/tui/cli.md
#
# Output is deterministic (registry order, no timestamps/versions) so the gate
# only fires on real CLI-surface changes. DO NOT edit docs/tui/cli.md by hand.
#
# NB: pipefail is intentionally OFF — the parse helpers below early-exit their
# `awk`, which SIGPIPEs the producing `ainb --help`; with pipefail+`set -e` that
# non-zero pipe status would abort generation mid-tree. cargo build is run
# unpiped, so we don't lose its failure signal.

title: "ainb CLI Reference"
description: "Full multi-hierarchy reference for every ainb subcommand — generated from the binary's --help."
---

`ainb` is both an interactive terminal UI and a scriptable, headless CLI. Every
operation the TUI performs is also exposed as a subcommand with `--format json`
output, so humans drive it from the dashboard and agents drive it from shell
scripts. Run `ainb` with no arguments to launch the TUI; use any subcommand
below for non-interactive work.

> **Generated — do not edit by hand.** This page is produced from the live
> binary by [`ainb-tui/scripts/gen-cli-reference.sh`](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box/blob/main/ainb-tui/scripts/gen-cli-reference.sh),
> which walks `ainb <cmd> --help` for every command. CI fails if it drifts, so
> the output of `ainb --help` stays the source of truth. To update: run the
> script and commit the result.

## Global flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--format <text\|json\|csv\|markdown>` | Output format for any command (default `text`). `json` is the machine-readable form for scripting/agents. |
| `-h, --help` | Print help for the command (recursive — works at every level). |
| `-V, --version` | Print the build identity (commit + date), or `-V` for the bare semver. |

## Reading this reference

Each command shows its description followed by the verbatim `ainb <cmd> --help`
output — including its arguments, flags, and an `EXAMPLES:` block. Groups
(`config`, `git`, `usage`, `fleet`, `hangar`, …) nest their subcommands as
sub-sections; recursive help (`ainb <group> <sub> --help`) works for every
node. The page's right-hand "On this page" panel is the full command tree.

## Skill manager

The skill-manager commands (`skill`, `source`, `search`, `migrate`) are
intercepted before clap and routed to the unit manager; they are documented in
their own section under [Skill manager](../skill-manager/guide) and surfaced in
`ainb --help` under "SKILL MANAGER". Run `ainb skill --help` for the full verb
list.

## Hidden / daemon commands

A few commands are hidden from `ainb --help` because they are internal
daemon/hook entrypoints rather than everyday verbs. Run `<cmd> --help` for each:

- `ainb notifyd <run|stop|install|uninstall|status|list>` — the ainb-hooks
  notification daemon. `ainb notifyd list [--format json]` reads persisted
  notifications headlessly; the TUI Inbox is the interactive view.
- `ainb statusline` — legacy Claude Code statusline alias (prefer
  `ainb claudecode statusline`).

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success. |
| `1` | Runtime error (the command ran but failed). This includes a missing provider CLI: `ainb run --tool codex` with no `codex` on `PATH` exits `1`, not `2`. |
| `2` | Usage error (bad flags/args), or a required *plugin* is not installed (e.g. `ainb usage` / `ainb learnings` with nothing staged under `dist/plugins/`). |

## Scripting recipes

```bash
# List running sessions as JSON and pull workspace names
# (the field is `workspace_name`; see `ainb list --format json`)
ainb list --running --format json | jq -r '.[].workspace_name'

# Spawn a session in an isolated worktree with an initial prompt
ainb run --repo . --worktree -p "fix the failing tests"

# Machine-readable diff of the working tree (no TUI)
ainb diff-review --format json | jq '.total_insertions, .total_deletions'

# Find orphaned sessions and clean them up
ainb recover list --format json && ainb recover cleanup

# Search the knowledge base headlessly
ainb learnings search "redis connection pooling" --format json
```
