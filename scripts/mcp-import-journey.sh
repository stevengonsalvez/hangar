# Journey harness for the MCP pool overlay's IMPORT action, recorded by vhs.
# Sets up an isolated $HOME + a project dir holding a `.mcp.json` (a real,
# host-resolvable stdio server) with NO pool daemon running, then execs the
# ainb TUI from inside that project so vhs can drive it:
#   `p` opens the overlay (empty — "Pool daemon not running")
#   `i` imports the launch dir's .mcp.json (+ Claude user scope) into the global
#       user config AND starts the pool daemon (which loads every configured
#       server on boot), so the imported server appears in the table. The
#       overlay is a global view, so import targets the user config (the one
#       read from anywhere), not a per-worktree project config.
#
# Self-contained & deterministic: own $HOME (never touches your real env),
# onboarding pre-completed so no wizard, a fake stdio MCP (no network).
