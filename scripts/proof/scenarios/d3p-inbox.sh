# D3-prime inbox: an issue created through the daemon by a separate process
# is aggregated into the local human's inbox, the open desktop window carries it
# in the inbox section it subscribes to from its first batch (read from the
# renderer's own telemetry rather than its pixels), the TUI's inbox screen
# draws the same row from the same section, and a mark-all-read sweep sent by
# a third process through the daemon's RPC is what both surfaces then show.
#
# Opening the page and sweeping from it is the wdio inbox journey's leg
# (crates/ainb-desktop/e2e/specs/inbox.e2e.js), which also asserts the row ids
# by value: a plain window has no driver to click with, exactly as d2-board
# leaves answering to answer.e2e.js.
