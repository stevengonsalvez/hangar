# P6e concurrency: the TUI, `ainb web` and the CLI against ONE daemon, with the
# sessions capability on, each surface reading and writing the daemon's table
# rather than its own copy of sessions.json.
#
#   {tui} {web} {tui,web} {tui,tui}   each with a CLI leg
#         │       │          │
#         └───────┴──────────┴──▶ one daemon, one $HOME, one sessions table
#
# Per combination, in order: every surface resolved the DAEMON (checked first,
# so a harness built without `test-support` fails here instead of proving the
# file path twice over); a session created from the TUI, which is not the CLI,
# reaches every other surface; an ASK answered on the web folds on the TUIs; a
# kill from the TUI, again not the CLI, leaves every surface; and after a
# reconcile this scenario asks for by hand, the table and the file hold the
# same sessions.
#
# Three things stand outside the combinations, each falsifying one rule:
#
#   * degraded and file-first: with no daemon up, a create still works and its
#     row is in `sessions.json`; a TUI started there says degraded, shows the
#     notice and switches once its daemon is up; and the session written while
#     degraded is in the table after the switch. A writer that wrote the table
#     first, or refused without one, fails the first half.
#   * the flock: a held `sessions.json.lock` makes a write WAIT for it, and the
#     write lands after the lock goes with the file still valid JSON. A writer
#     that took no lock would return at once and fail the wait.
#   * the kill switch: `AINB_SESSION_SOURCE=file` puts one process on the file
#     end to end, and what it wrote is in the table after a reconcile. What it
#     KILLED is not taken from the table by a pass: a pass adds and never takes
#     away, so that row waits for a kill through a current surface.
#
#   * the mirror: with `sessions.json` moved away, the rows ainb web serves
#     are still the table's. While both agree, equality cannot tell a surface
#     reading the table from one reading the file; with no file to read, it
#     can.
#
# Since the flip (P6e-6) the capability comes from the binary's own catalogue,
# so this scenario sets no switch: an ordinary build of these binaries is what
# is under test.
#
# Combination names match scripts/surface-combo-smoke.sh, which is where the
# four came from (P6e open question 5).
