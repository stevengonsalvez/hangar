EXPECT="a fixture session with a hook-raised ASK renders waiting · hook · tier 0 · Ns (a real age in seconds) in the Fleet panel, and once the daemon is stopped the panel says so on screen: offline, states unverifiable, host unreachable"

# Filed from this harness's first runs, each with its capture and source cite:
# the panel clock never ticks so the age renders `?` (#1054), and a stopped
# daemon shows only the offline banner, not the unreachable story (#1058).
