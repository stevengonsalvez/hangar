# Generate the ainb(1) man page (docs/man/ainb.1) from the real `ainb` binary.
#
# The COMMANDS section is generated: every top-level command's one-line "about"
# and its immediate subcommand names come straight from the binary's recursive
# `--help`, so the index can never drift from the actual CLI. Everything else
# (DESCRIPTION, EXAMPLES, SPAWNING SESSIONS FROM AN AGENT, FILES, ENVIRONMENT,
# EXIT STATUS) is authored prose that a --help dump cannot express.
#
# Driving the real binary (rather than clap_mangen over the clap tree) is not a
# style choice, it is the only faithful option:
#   * `tui` and `diff-review` are attached in main.rs AFTER the reusable
#     builders, so no library-visible `clap::Command` contains them. Proof:
#     `ainb completion zsh | grep -c diff-review` is 0 while `ainb --help`
#     lists it. clap_mangen wired the same way inherits the same hole.
#   * `skill` / `source` / `search` are intercepted before clap exists at all
#     and routed to ainb-cli, yet they answer `--help` and are advertised in
#     `ainb --help`. No clap-tree generator can see them.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/gen-man.sh                                  # builds ainb (release)
#   AINB_BIN=target/debug/ainb scripts/gen-man.sh       # reuse a built bin
#
# CI freshness gate (see .github/workflows/ci.yml, job `cli-docs`):
#   AINB_BIN=target/debug/ainb bash scripts/gen-man.sh
#   git diff --exit-code -- docs/man/ainb.1
#
# Output is deterministic: registry order, and NO version string, NO build date,
# NO timestamp anywhere (including `.TH`). A version in the header would make
# every Cargo.toml bump turn the gate red for a page whose content did not
# change, so the gate only fires on real CLI-surface changes.
# DO NOT edit docs/man/ainb.1 by hand.
#
# NB: pipefail is intentionally OFF, for the same reason as
# gen-cli-reference.sh: the shared walk helpers early-exit their `awk`, which
# SIGPIPEs the producing `ainb --help`; with pipefail + `set -e` that non-zero
# pipe status would abort generation mid-tree. cargo build runs unpiped, so its
# failure signal is not lost.

.SH NAME
ainb \- spawn and manage AI coding sessions in isolated git worktrees

.RB [ \-h | \-\-help ]
.RB [ \-V | \-\-version ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ainb
("agents in a box") runs AI coding agents as first\-class, supervised
processes. It is two things behind one binary:
.PP
An interactive terminal UI, launched by running
.B ainb
with no arguments. The dashboard lists every session on the host, streams their
output, shows diffs, usage and notifications, and can attach straight into a
session's tmux pane.
.PP
A headless, scriptable CLI. Every operation the TUI performs is also a
subcommand, and every subcommand accepts
.B \-\-format json
so agents and shell scripts can drive it. This is the interface an orchestrating
agent should use: see
.B SPAWNING SESSIONS FROM AN AGENT
below.
.PP
A session is a tmux session running a provider CLI (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini,
Copilot) inside a working directory, plus persisted metadata so the TUI, the
fleet tooling and ATC can find it again after a restart. The working directory
should be a dedicated
.BR git\-worktree (1),
not your everyday checkout: see
.B WORKTREES AND WORKSPACE NAMES.
.SH OPTIONS
These are accepted at every level of the command tree.
.TP
.BI \-\-format " text|json|csv|markdown"
Output format for the command (default
.BR text ).
.B json
is the machine\-readable form: stable field names, safe to pipe into
.BR jq (1).
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Print help. Recursive: it works on every command and subcommand, and each one
carries its own
.B EXAMPLES
block.
.TP
.BR \-V ", " \-\-version
Print the build identity (commit and date).
.B \-V
alone prints the bare semver.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Launch the TUI
.RS 4
.nf
ainb
.fi
.RE
.PP
The dashboard: every session on the host, live output, diffs, usage and
notifications. This is the same data the subcommands below return.
.SS Spawn an isolated session on a new branch
.RS 4
.nf
ainb run \-\-repo . \-\-create\-branch feat/oauth \-p "wire up oauth login"
.fi
.RE
.PP
Cuts branch
.B feat/oauth
in a fresh git worktree at
.IR ~/.agents\-in\-a\-box/worktrees/by\-name/myapp\-\-feat\-oauth\-\-<8charid> ,
starts Claude Code there, and sends the prompt once the input box is ready. Your
own checkout is untouched, so you can keep working while the agent does.
.SS Spawn an isolated session on an auto\-named branch
.RS 4
.nf
ainb run \-\-repo ~/src/myapp \-\-worktree
.fi
.RE
.PP
Same isolation, but the branch is named
.RI ainb/session\- <8\-char\-id>
for you. Use this when the branch name does not matter yet.
.SS Spawn against an existing worktree
.RS 4
.nf
ainb run \-\-repo ~/.agents\-in\-a\-box/worktrees/by\-name/myapp\-\-feat\-oauth\-\-a1b2c3d4
.fi
.RE
.PP
Reuses a worktree that already exists (for example, to put a second agent on
work another session started). No new worktree is created and no warning is
printed, because the target is already isolated from your checkout.
.SS Spawn with Codex instead of Claude
.RS 4
.nf
ainb run \-\-repo . \-\-worktree \-\-tool codex
.fi
.RE
.PP
Runs the Codex CLI in the worktree.
.B \-\-tool
accepts
.BR claude ", " codex ", " gemini " and " copilot ;
.B \-\-model
passes a provider model id straight through, unvalidated.
.SS Spawn with an initial prompt and drop straight into it
.RS 4
.nf
ainb run \-\-repo . \-\-worktree \-p "port the auth tests to nextest" \-\-attach
.fi
.RE
.PP
Creates the session, sends the prompt, then attaches your terminal to its tmux
pane. Detach with
.BR Ctrl\-B ", " d
and the agent keeps running.
.SS List sessions as JSON
.RS 4
.nf
ainb list \-\-format json | jq \-r '.[] | select(.is_running) | .workspace_name'
.fi
.RE
.PP
The machine\-readable inventory. This is how the fleet tooling discovers
sessions, and it is the verification step after spawning anything.
.SS Attach to a running session
.RS 4
.nf
ainb attach myapp
.fi
.RE
.PP
Drops you into the session's tmux. The argument is a session id, a unique id
prefix, or a workspace name (see
.BR "WORKTREES AND WORKSPACE NAMES" ).
.SS Inspect a session's status
.RS 4
.nf
ainb status myapp \-\-format json
.fi
.RE
.PP
Health, provider, branch, worktree path and activity for one session, without
attaching to it.
.SS Read a session's output without attaching
.RS 4
.nf
ainb logs myapp
.fi
.RE
.PP
Safe to run from a script or another agent: it never takes over your terminal.
.SS Kill a session
.RS 4
.nf
ainb kill myapp
ainb kill 88dd9219 \-\-force
.fi
.RE
.PP
Terminates the tmux session and removes the record.
.B \-\-force
skips the confirmation. The worktree is left on disk; remove it with
.B ainb git
if you are done with the branch.
.SS Find and clean up orphans
.RS 4
.nf
ainb recover list \-\-format json
ainb recover cleanup
.fi
.RE
.PP
Orphans are records whose tmux session died, or tmux sessions with no record
(after a crash or a reboot).
.B list
reports,
.B cleanup
reconciles.
.SS Generate shell completions
.RS 4
.nf
ainb completion zsh > ~/.zfunc/_ainb
.fi
.RE
.PP
Supports
.BR bash ", " zsh ", " fish ", " powershell " and " elvish .
.SH SPAWNING SESSIONS FROM AN AGENT
This is the contract for an orchestrating agent (or any script) that spawns
sessions. Getting it wrong produces sessions that collide with each other, or
that the TUI and fleet tooling cannot address.
.TP
.B Always pass \-\-worktree or \-\-create\-branch.
Without one of them the session's working directory
.I is the checkout you pointed at.
There is no isolation: the agent shares that branch, index and working tree with
your editor and with every other session started there, so two concurrent
sessions will overwrite each other's edits and stage each other's files. Prefer
.B \-\-create\-branch
when you know what the work is called,
.B \-\-worktree
when you do not.
.B ainb run
prints a warning to standard error when it detects this, but it does not refuse:
the spawn still succeeds, so a script must not rely on a non\-zero exit to catch
it.
.TP
.B Do not treat \-\-name as a handle.
.B \-\-name
only overrides the tmux session name. It does
.I not
become a handle you can use later:
.BR "ainb attach" ", " "ainb status" " and " "ainb kill"
resolve their argument as a session id, a unique id prefix, or a
.I workspace
name, and the workspace name is derived from the repository directory, never
from
.BR \-\-name .
Let the default name stand (\fIworkspace\fR\-\fI8charid\fR) and address the
session by the id that
.B ainb list \-\-format json
returns.
.TP
.BI \-\-parent " <id>"
links the new session to an orchestrator. The child's Stop hook routes its
completion into the parent's durable inbox, so the orchestrator is woken by an
event instead of polling. Pass the orchestrator's own session identity, which is
exported into every ainb\-spawned session as
.BR AINB_PARENT_SESSION ,
or the stable ATC handle (for example
.BR tower ).
Without
.BR \-\-parent ,
completions go nowhere and you are back to polling.
.TP
.B Verify, do not assume.
.B ainb run
exits 0 as soon as the tmux session is up. Confirm the session exists and is
running before reporting success:
.RS
.RS 4
.nf
ainb list \-\-format json | jq \-e '.[] | select(.workspace_name == "myapp")'
.fi
.RE
.RE
.PP
Putting it together, the shape an agent should emit is:
.RS 4
.nf
ainb run \-\-repo "$REPO" \-\-create\-branch "feat/$TASK" \\
         \-\-parent "$AINB_PARENT_SESSION" \\
         \-p "$TASK_PROMPT"
ainb list \-\-format json | jq \-r '.[] | select(.is_running) | .session_id'
.fi
.RE
.SH WORKTREES AND WORKSPACE NAMES
A session's
.I workspace name
is how humans and the TUI address it, and it is derived from the session's
directory, not from anything you pass on the command line.
.PP
When the session runs in a linked git worktree, ainb can resolve that worktree
back to the repository it belongs to (a linked worktree's
.I .git
is a file pointing at the real git directory) and names the workspace after it.
When the session's directory has no
.I .git
entry at all anywhere above it, there is nothing to resolve and the session is
reported as
.BR (broken) :
its directory is gone or was never a repository.
.PP
A plain clone, where
.I .git
is a directory, is a perfectly valid place to run a session and is named after
that directory. It is simply not
.I isolated:
that is what the warning from
.B ainb run
is about, and it is why
.B \-\-worktree
exists.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I ~/.agents\-in\-a\-box/
Everything ainb persists, for the current user. Never
.IR ~/.ainb/ .
.TP
.I ~/.agents\-in\-a\-box/sessions.json
The session store: one record per session (id, workspace name, tmux session
name, worktree path, branch, provider). This is what
.B ainb list
reads and what
.BR "ainb attach" / "status" / "kill"
resolve against.
.TP
.I ~/.agents\-in\-a\-box/config/config.toml
User configuration. Edit through
.B ainb config
rather than by hand.
.TP
.I ~/.agents\-in\-a\-box/worktrees/
Where
.B \-\-worktree
and
.B \-\-create\-branch
put the git worktrees they create, one directory per session. Two views of the
same set:
.I by\-name/<repo>\-\-<branch>\-\-<8charid>
is the real directory,
.I by\-session/<uuid>
is a symlink to it.
.TP
.I ~/.agents\-in\-a\-box/logs/
JSONL logs, one file per run. The first place to look when a spawn or a daemon
misbehaves.
.TP
.I ./.ainb/config.toml
Per\-repository overrides, read from the repository ainb is pointed at.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B AINB_HOME
Relocates ainb's state so a test run or a throwaway fleet does not touch your
real one. Be aware that it is interpreted two different ways today: the session
store and the worktree manager treat it as a stand\-in for
.B $HOME
and still append
.IR .agents\-in\-a\-box ,
while the fleet/ATC plumbing treats it as the state directory itself. Set it for
isolation, not as a permanent relocation.
.TP
.B AINB_PARENT_SESSION
Set by ainb inside a session spawned with
.BR "\-\-parent <id>" .
The child's Stop hook reads it to route completions to that parent's inbox. An
orchestrating agent reads its own value to pass down to grandchildren.
.TP
.B AINB_BIN
The
.B ainb
executable that ainb's own subprocesses should shell out to. Set it when a
freshly built binary must not lose to a stale one on
.BR PATH .
.TP
.B AINB_PLUGIN_ROOT
Plugin staging directory to load from. First entry in the search order, ahead of
the release\-tarball, workspace and installed
.RI ( ~/.agents\-in\-a\-box/plugins/cache/ )
locations. Ignored if the path does not exist.
.TP
.B AINB_DISABLE_PLUGINS
Set to
.BR 1 / true / yes / on
to run with the plugin runtime off. Anything else, including unset, leaves
plugins enabled, so a typo cannot silently disable them.
.TP
.B AINB_HANGAR_HOME
State directory for the Hangar managed\-agents control plane.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Success.
.TP
.B 1
Runtime error: the command ran and failed. This includes a missing provider
CLI:
.B ainb run \-\-tool codex
with no
.B codex
on
.B PATH
exits 1, not 2.
.TP
.B 2
Usage error (bad flags or arguments), or a required
.I plugin
is not installed (for example
.B ainb usage
or
.B ainb learnings
with nothing staged under
.IR dist/plugins/ ).
