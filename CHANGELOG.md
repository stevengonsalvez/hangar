### Other
- pin reflect plugin to v5.0.4
- **notifyd**: close nc liveness probe with -N
- **tui**: drop the Boss/container option from new-session
- **tui**: hide docker/boss/container from the setup surface

### Removed
- **cli**: remove the `ainb migrate` subcommand. Its `--clean` mode wiped each
  tool's entire install root (e.g. all of `~/.claude`) before re-syncing from
  the manifest, which destroyed user state (`CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`,
  `projects/` history, `memory/`, custom agents). Installs are additive via
  `ainb skill install` / `ainb skill sync`; discover + adopt now lives in the
  Skill Manager TUI.

### Changed
- **skill manager**: the `[r]` remove key now requires a confirm — the first
  press arms, a second press on the same unit uninstalls. Moving the cursor or
  leaving the screen cancels.

### Security
- **adapters**: `uninstall` now hard-refuses any path that resolves into
  protected user state (`projects/`, `memory/`, `todos/`, `settings.json`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, …) or escapes the install root, guarding against a corrupt
  lockfile deleting non-unit files.

- **reflect**: extract AdapterBase to remove ~80% adapter duplication

### Changed
- **BREAKING (ainb-tui usage cache)**: bumped the cache blob format to
  V3 (`BLOB_FORMAT_BINCODE_CURRENT = 3`). Caches built under V1
  (pre-branch) or V2 (Local-timestamp) are recognised as stale and
  skipped on first run after upgrade — the affected files are
  re-parsed from the underlying JSONL transparently. No user action
  required, but the first analytics scan after the bump will be
  slower than usual while the cache rebuilds. The bump folds two
  layout changes:
  - `ProviderCall.timestamp` migrated from `DateTime<Local>` to
    `DateTime<Utc>` so cached blobs are timezone-independent
    (cache vs full-reparse no longer drifts after a timezone move
    or DST transition). Display is still local — render sites
    convert via `.with_timezone(&Local)` at the boundary.
  - `ProviderCall.id: u64` added (stable hash of `path:offset`) so
    `analyze_turns` results can be precomputed once on the
    unfiltered call set; chip-pivot re-aggregates in
    `filter_usage_data` now skip the per-session timeline rewalk.
- **BREAKING (ainb-tui CLI)**: `--include` no longer treats `--project` as
  an alias. Users must migrate `--project foo` filters that relied on
  substring matching to `--include foo` (substring match) or keep
  `--project foo` for exact-match. The split makes intent explicit:
  `--include` is the substring-match flag, `--project` is the exact
  cross-filter chip equivalent of clicking a project in the burndown.

### Added
- **ainb-tui**: branch attribution panel data — `BranchUsage` rows on
  `UsageData` aggregate per-`gitBranch` token totals (rendering wired
  in a follow-on; data is already available via the cache).
- **ainb-tui**: `recover_user_message_before` recovers `user_message`
  attribution on cache-hit append paths so cached and full-reparse
  rows agree turn-for-turn.
- **ainb-tui**: `model_project_counts` precomputed index on `UsageData`
  removes the O(N·M) per-render scan for "top projects per model".

### Fixed
- **ainb-tui**: cache `clear` now `VACUUM`s so the on-disk db shrinks.
- **ainb-tui**: cache write rejects non-UTF8 paths instead of silent
  lossy collisions.
- **ainb-tui**: append parser rolls back `end_offset` on I/O errors,
  preventing silent data loss on the next scan.
- **ainb-tui**: fuzzy-search routes non-ASCII queries through
  `Utf32String` so unicode queries match unicode haystacks.
- **ainb-tui**: `last_day_of_month` returns `Option` for invalid input
  instead of silently producing the 28th.
- **ainb-tui**: session-duration column distinguishes `0m` from `<1m`.
