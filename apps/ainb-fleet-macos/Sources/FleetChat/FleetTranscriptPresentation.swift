// The Swift half of the ACP transcript taxonomy, in pure display terms so the
// tests can hold it without a window.
//
// This is a PORT of `AcpClassifier` in
// `crates/ainb-hangar-proto/src/transcript.rs`, arm for arm, and the
// point of the port is that the notch and the terminal client read one
// transcript the same way. An operator watching both surfaces must not have to
// learn two vocabularies for one tool call, so every string this file emits is
// the string the Rust side emits: the same double spaces, the same `[error]`
// suffix, the same `· <subtype> · <duration>` run-status line, the same
// `plan · <status> · <content>` checklist row.
//
// The deliberate divergences, all forced by the representation rather than
// chosen, are named where they occur: object key ORDER in a compact JSON
// rendering (a Swift dictionary has no insertion order), the codex and
// stream-json arms (this client never reads a process executor's transcript),
// and `acp_row_text` (its only caller is the daemon's PR-URL scanner).
//
// The caps are NOT among them. They count the same unit the Rust counts, down
// to Unicode scalars rather than Swift `Character`s; see `truncateChars` for
// why that distinction is the difference between a bound and no bound.
//
// There is no scrub in this file, and that is not an omission. The Rust
// classifier scrubs before it cuts (#1187), because a cut through a credential
// leaves a prefix no shape matches. Here every payload arrives as a
// `FleetTranscriptChunk` from `fleet/transcript_list` or
// `fleet/transcript_event`, and the daemon scrubs each string value of that
// payload before the chunk leaves it (`transcript_chunk_wire`, #1199), so every
// cut below runs on text that is already scrubbed. A new input that does not
// come through those two methods needs its own scrub before any cap applies.
//
// Every `switch` below is exhaustive with NO `default`, per the rule
// `FleetChatPresentation.swift` states: a new lane or a new JSON shape must
// fail to COMPILE rather than fall through to whichever arm was written last.
