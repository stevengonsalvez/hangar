import XCTest

/// Base for the shell journeys, which drive the REAL app against a fixture
/// daemon rather than a mock.
///
/// These do not run in CI, and the attempt is recorded here so nobody repeats
/// it. A GitHub-hosted macOS runner has no usable GUI session for a real app:
/// the launch hangs for around two minutes and then fails with "Application
/// 'dev.ainb.fleet' does not have a process ID", and it does so for every
/// journey, including ones that pass locally in seconds. Signing is not the
/// problem, and a UI runner does need signing, so the step cannot simply borrow
/// the CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO the unit step above it uses.
///
/// Run them by hand, from the repository root:
///
///     xcodebuild test \
///       -project apps/ainb-fleet-macos/AINBFleet.xcodeproj \
///       -scheme FleetUITests \
///       -destination 'platform=macOS'
///
/// Two things the machine needs first. The terminal invoking xcodebuild must be
/// allowed under Privacy and Security, Accessibility, or every journey dies at
/// "Timed out while enabling automation mode" before a single test is selected.
/// And when that timeout appears anyway on a machine that has the permission,
/// `testmanagerd` is wedged: kill it by its exact process id, let launchd
/// restart it, and re-run. That happened twice in one session while these
/// journeys were being written.
///
/// The fixture daemon binary is resolved as
/// `<repo>/target/debug/examples/fleet_fixture_daemon`, so build it
/// first. `AINB_FLEET_FIXTURE_DAEMON` is read by the runner process but does
/// NOT survive being set in the shell that invokes xcodebuild; symlink the
/// binary into place instead.
