# No orphaned `codex app-server` processes

## Problem

Twice in 26 hours a 32 GB Mac hung machine-wide (every new window "not
responding", `kernel_task` pinned) because background daemons had quietly
manufactured hundreds of orphaned `codex app-server` processes. Round 1: 1017
procs / 16.4 GB RSS / 909 orphaned at `ppid == 1`, swap 27.4 of 28.6 GB. Round
2 (~26 h later) refilled to 567 / 11.1 GB / 554 orphans.

Two independent spawners leak, and they share one bug class: **all cleanup
lives on the happy exit path**, which never runs on `SIGKILL`, OOM reap, crash,
or power cut.

- **Source A, the ainb hangar daemon.** Spawns one shared `codex app-server` on
  `~/.agents-in-a-box/codex-app-server.sock`. Two failures: (1) `prepare_socket`
  did an unlocked check-then-act and `wait_for_socket` only proved the socket
  *path* appeared, not that *this* child bound it, so concurrent spawns each kept
  a duplicate server (four codex procs held the same socket at once, by `lsof`);
  (2) every teardown is Rust `Drop` (`kill_on_drop`), which `SIGKILL` skips.
- **Source B, the `openai-codex` Claude Code plugin broker (`/codex:rescue`).**
  `lib/broker-lifecycle.mjs` mkdtemps a fresh dir per session
  (`${tmpdir}/cxc-XXXXXX/broker.sock`) and spawns the broker `detached: true` +
  `child.unref()`. The only reaper is the `SessionEnd` hook, and because each
  socket path is unique, nothing ever adopts a survivor, so every leak is
  permanent and additive. ~624 stale `cxc-*` temp dirs were standing.

## Process-shape facts (verified live, informs every filter)

| Process | argv | ppid | reaped? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Daemon-spawned server (Source A) | `node /Users/…/bin/codex app-server --listen unix://…` | 1 after launcher exit | **if no live proxy** |
| Plugin broker server (Source B) | `node /…/bin/codex app-server --listen unix:///var/folders/…/cxc-…/broker.sock` | 1 after launcher exit | **if no live proxy** |
| Fleet proxy | `node /…/bin/codex app-server proxy --sock …` | any | **never** |
| Desktop Codex/ChatGPT app | `/Applications/ChatGPT.app/Contents/Resources/codex … app-server …` | ≠ 1 | **never** |

`codex` on PATH is a node shim, so a daemon that spawns bare `codex` still shows
`node …/bin/codex app-server` in `ps args`, which is why the spec's
`grep '[b]in/codex'` filter catches Source-A orphans even though the daemon
never passes a full path. The desktop app is excluded twice over: no `bin/codex`
in its path **and** `ppid != 1`. The reap filter is therefore:
`ppid == 1` AND argv contains `bin/codex` AND server `app-server --listen`
AND no live `app-server proxy --sock` targets that server socket.

## Fix

Three layers, none of which depend on an exit path running:

1. **Race fix (Source A).** `socket_listener_pids()` (returns `None` when `lsof`
   cannot answer, never "nobody") + `bound_by_child()` so a race loser reaps
   its own child and adopts the winner's server instead of stranding it.
   (`codex_manager.rs`, committed separately.)
2. **Daemon-owned reaper (both sources).** `reap_orphaned_codex_servers()` reads
   `ps -Ao pid,ppid,args`, selects `ppid == 1` codex app-server processes,
   excludes proxy processes, spares every server socket targeted by a live proxy
   across all Hangar homes, spares the daemon's own adoption socket, and
   `SIGTERM`s the rest by exact pid via `nix`. It runs at daemon
   boot (before we spawn our own server) AND on the daemon's periodic sweeper
   tick, so a long-running daemon keeps the machine clean. This is the only
   backstop that survives `SIGKILL`/OOM, and it reaps **both** sources' orphans
   because both share the `bin/codex … app-server` shape. Dead Source-A and
   Source-B servers have no live proxy targeting their socket, so both get
   reaped.
3. **Scoped ownership.** Ainb only adopts or reuses its exact configured socket.
   Other Codex clients and IDEs remain external diagnostics and never gate Ainb
   startup. The reaper and exact-socket race check, not a machine-wide process
   count, bound Ainb's own lifecycle.

### Why the daemon owns cleanup (no Claude Code hook)

The reaper lives entirely inside the ainb daemon (boot + periodic sweep). We do
**not** ship a Claude Code `SessionStart` hook or edit `~/.claude/settings.json`,
and we do **not** touch the vendored third-party `openai-codex` plugin. The
daemon reaps every unproxied `ppid == 1` codex app-server machine-wide while
sparing live consumers across all Hangar homes, so a running daemon is the
single cleanup owner. Trade-off: a machine that runs the codex plugin with
**no** ainb daemon gets no backstop, but such a machine is outside ainb's reach.
A proper Source-B fix (shared-socket broker, or a broker that self-terminates on
parent death) is upstream territory (logged below).

## Decision: retain the hand-rolled socket ownership (success criterion 2)

The spec offered a choice: delete `prepare_socket` / `socket_owner_marker` /
`repair_owner_marker` / `socket_disposition` / `bound_by_child` in favour of
`codex app-server daemon start|stop`, **or** retain them behind a documented
rationale. We retain them.

- `codex app-server daemon start` exists and gives single-instance for free, but
  migrating the working Fleet transport onto it is a large, risky rewrite of the
  read/write actor, proxy wiring, and cleanup, for a guarantee we already
  replicate now that `bound_by_child` closes the duplicate-spawn race.
- It would **not** remove the reaper. `codex app-server --help` exposes no idle /
  timeout / parent-death / shutdown flag, so a daemon-managed server still
  orphans on `SIGKILL`. The startup reaper is required either way, and it is the
  layer that actually satisfies "zero orphans after 20 SIGKILLs".
- The retained code is already tested (the `codex_manager` unit suite) and its
  correctness is not what caused the leak: the missing SIGKILL-independent
  backstop was. Adopting the codex daemon is filed as a follow-up, not a blocker.

## How to run / test

```bash
# Rust: reaper + race fix
cargo test -p ainb-hangar-daemon
cargo fmt --check

# Soak proof (success criterion 1): 20x SIGKILL the daemon, prove no accumulation
scripts/soak-codex-orphans.sh 20

# Scale proof: clear a 25-orphan pile, spare another home's proxy-backed server,
# then reap that server after its proxy exits.
scripts/reap-stress-codex-orphans.sh 25
```

The soak isolates `AINB_HANGAR_HOME`, SIGKILLs the daemon 20×, and reports the
**peak** orphan count, which stays bounded at ~1 (`bound_by_child` + boot
adoption never accumulate; the pre-fix incident reached 900+ here) while the
desktop app server stays alive. The scale proof starts a real daemon over a pile
of foreign-socket orphans, proves another home's proxy-backed server survives,
then proves the periodic reaper clears it after that proxy exits.

## Why the reaper is safe: consumer liveness overrides `ppid == 1`

`codex app-server --listen unix://<sock>` can remain at `ppid == 1` after its
original daemon exits. A restarted daemon can adopt that listener and keep using
it through `app-server proxy --sock`, so `ppid == 1` is an orphan candidate,
not proof that the server is unused.

The reaper correlates every live proxy target with every candidate server
socket across the complete process snapshot. A proxy-backed server is spared
regardless of `AINB_HANGAR_HOME`. The daemon's own listener is also spared
during adoption before its proxy starts. Only unproxied candidates are
signalled.

## Known limitations / follow-ups

- **Idle machine leaves one server.** When no daemon is running, the single
  shared-socket server lingers at `ppid == 1` (reused via adoption on the next
  boot, never accumulated). Only a running daemon reaps; there is no idle-time
  reaper by design. This is the accepted cost of daemon-owned cleanup.
- **Native grandchildren.** A reaped `node …/bin/codex` launcher may leave a
  `vendor/…/bin/codex` grandchild that reparents to init; it is caught on the
  next boot/periodic reap (eventual convergence).
- **User-run `codex app-server`.** The `ppid==1` heuristic cannot tell an
  ainb/plugin orphan from a `codex app-server --listen` someone runs on purpose
  (e.g. a launchd `KeepAlive` service on a foreign socket with no ainb proxy):
  both look orphaned and would be reaped. Acceptable given the incident's scope; a
  socket-location allowlist would exclude such sockets if it ever matters.
- **PID-reuse TOCTOU.** A pid can in principle be recycled between the `ps` read
  and the `SIGTERM`. The window is tiny and the signal is `SIGTERM` (not
  `SIGKILL`); the socket-owner path guards with a process-start fingerprint, the
  reaper does not re-verify argv before signalling.
- **`input_box_ready` markers.** `ainb run -p` readiness keys on the CLIs' footer
  strings ("? for shortcuts", …); a copy change degrades it to the 30 s timeout,
  which still SENDS the prompt (never drops it).
- **Upstream ask (Source B).** The real Source-B fix is a shared-socket broker or
  a broker that dies with its parent (`PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` is Linux-only; macOS
  needs a supervisor/pipe-EOF wrapper). Filed upstream against `openai-codex`;
  the daemon's boot + periodic reaper is the local backstop while a daemon runs
  (a codex-plugin machine with no ainb daemon is uncovered).
- **`ainb run -p` fix** (separate bug, fixed alongside): the initial prompt was
  sent after a fixed 2 s sleep into a not-yet-ready Claude splash and lost; now it
  polls `capture-pane` for the input box before sending, and targets the session
  by name (no hardcoded `:0`).
