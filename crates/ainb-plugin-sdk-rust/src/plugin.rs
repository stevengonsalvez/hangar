//! The [`Plugin`] trait every ainb plugin implements.
//!
//! Concrete plugins are author-defined types stored as the
//! [`Server`](crate::server::Server)'s state. Each handler receives a
//! `&mut self` (the server serialises access via a [`tokio::sync::Mutex`])
//! and a borrowed [`HostClient`] for reverse-direction calls (snapshot
//! publish, action invoke, log) that the plugin wants to issue mid-handler.
//!
//! The `Send + 'static` bound is required so the runtime can park the
//! plugin on a tokio task. `#[async_trait]` makes the futures `Send` by
//! default.
