// Two hook lines, not one, and the reason is a product gap rather than the
// harness (#1049): a Claude session row never learns its provider session id,
// so the sidebar takes only a question raised with no session id (matched by
// its unique worktree), while the board's waiting card needs one raised with
// the id its Fleet session carries. One line per half, same question, same
// worktree. The row with the id is never answered, so its card is still
// waiting when the journey ends; it is asserted that way, not as answered,
// and #1049 is what lets one question do both.
