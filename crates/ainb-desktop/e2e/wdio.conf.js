// The desktop journey's runner. The app under test is a debug build with the
// `wdio` feature on, which carries the embedded WebDriver the service drives;
// a release build carries no driver at all, which the bundle smoke asserts.
//
// The world is built in `onPrepare` and torn down in `onComplete`, so the
// workers the launcher forks after it, and the app the service launches, all
// inherit its HOME, hangar home and tmux server.
//
// One world per launcher, and so one runner at a time (#1160). The embedded
// provider spawns the app once, from the launcher's own `onPrepare`, before any
// worker exists: a world per worker could not reach it. The spec files run one
// after another against that one app and that one world, in the order listed,
// and a config that asks for two at once is refused rather than left to share
// a HOME, a hangar home and a tmux server whose teardown pulls the ground from
// under the other.
