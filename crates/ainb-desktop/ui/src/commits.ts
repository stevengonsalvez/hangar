// intents it sends back.
//
// Every row is the reducer's own (`ainb-app/src/components/git_view.rs:41`,
// `CommitInfo`): the webview runs no git, reads no log and mints no row. A
// click names the commit's SHORT HASH, which is the id the frame carries
// (`ainb-app/src/app/pointer.rs`, `git_view.select_commit`), never an index:
// the list is cut to a byte budget on the wire and can move under a click.
//
// There is no commit scroll offset in the model. The terminal keeps the
// selected commit in view with ratatui's own list state, so the SELECTION is
// the scroll (`components/git_view.rs:258-276`), and this window does the
// same: the page it draws is the one the selection sits in.
