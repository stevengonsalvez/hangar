 * The ACP card: an ACP session's transcript, standing where its terminal would
 * be, because it has no tmux pane to show.
 *
 * Each chunk is drawn with its kind (the agent's message, its thinking, a tool
 * call, a plan, a permission it asked for), as the daemon's own classifier
 * renders it and scrubbed on the host. The prompt echo and the usage report,
 * which that classifier leaves silent, arrive with the host's card text
 * (`acp_card_text`): what the operator asked, and the context and cost.
 *
 * Read-only: answering a permission goes through the board's attention list,
 * as every other question does.
