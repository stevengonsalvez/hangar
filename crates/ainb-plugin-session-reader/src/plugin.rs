//! Session-reader [`Plugin`] implementation.

//! Pure data-plane plugin: no UI, no CLI namespace. On startup
//! ([`Plugin::on_init`]) it scans the four provider directories,
//! aggregates a [`UsageData`] snapshot, and publishes it on the
//! `sessions.usage_data` topic. While running it answers
//! [`SnapshotGet`](`HostClient::snapshot_get`)-style requests by simply
//! republishing the cached snapshot — but since the host already
//! tracks the latest publish per topic, plugins typically just rely on
//! the host's snapshot store. We re-scan when the host pushes a
//! `sessions.refresh_request` event.
