// C2 web ASK-answer journey (spec P8 / verify-converged CC-web leg).
//
// Proves the whole converged answer path through a REAL browser:
//   1. the dashboard renders the seeded 3-option ASK card via the daemon's
//      attention inbox (GET /api/snapshot → daemon attention/list, D18);
//   2. clicking option ② POSTs /api/answer → the daemon's ONE verified send
//      path delivers into the raising session's live tmux pane;
//   3. the answered row drops off the open inbox, so the ASK card disappears on
//      the re-pull (the RPC-level proof the flip happened);
//   4. the picked keystroke actually lands in the seeded target tmux pane
//      (capture-pane — the last mile the UI cannot itself show);
//   5. the daemon store records the row `answered` by `web` carrying the pick
//      (the by-surface attribution that is the entire point of C2).
//
// The runner script exports every coordinate this test needs.
