// ABOUTME: tmux send-keys + has-session wrappers. The payload goes out as ONE
// literal write, Enter is pressed only once the payload is observed in the
// composer, and the send is then verified against the pane before it is
// reported as delivered.
//
// Uses `-l` literal mode for the text to prevent prompt-injection via
// shell metacharacters; sends Enter as a key event afterwards.
//
// The payload is passed AFTER a `--` end-of-options terminator: without it a
// `text` that begins with `-` (e.g. an interview option label `-y` / `--no`, or
// a `fleet broadcast` prompt) is parsed by tmux as a flag rather than literal
// keys, silently dropping (or corrupting) the send.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT WAS MEASURED (claude 2.1.224 / tmux 3.6a / macOS; captures kept in
// `pane_fixtures/`, provenance in the test module below)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//   * A macOS PTY delivers at most 1022 bytes per `read()`, so one
//     `send-keys -l` of N bytes arrives as ceil(N/1022) reads.
//   * Claude Code classifies a single read of >=801 chars as a PASTE and draws
//     one `[Pasted text #N]` placeholder for it. Newlines are irrelevant.
//   * Whether the trailing Enter submits depends on whether the CR lands in its
//     OWN read. On an idle target it does (a 1-byte read a few ms later) and
//     the turn is submitted. On a busy target the CR is appended to bytes still
//     in flight, arrives INSIDE the payload's final read, and is consumed as a
//     literal newline inside the paste buffer, so nothing is submitted. The
//     composer then shows `[Pasted text #N +1 lines]`, where `+1 lines` IS the
//     swallowed Enter.
//   * Retrying Enter into a still-draining pane does not help: Enters at +1.0s,
//     +1.7s and +3.9s all arrived fused onto the same final read as `\r\r\r`.
//     There is no safe fixed delay; the wait must be OBSERVED, and it must be
//     observed ON THE PAYLOAD, since an untouched composer looks identical to
//     one that finished ingesting.
//   * A delay sweep over 900..16000 bytes showed a single unchunked write
//     submits cleanly at every size once the Enter is not fused. Chunking the
//     payload under the paste threshold therefore buys nothing the ingest gate
//     does not already buy, and it costs the `[Pasted text #N]` placeholder
//     that [`pane_has_unsubmitted_input`] (the ATC coalesce guard) relies on.
//     So: ONE write, exactly as `main` does.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE VERIFICATION LOOKS AT EMPTINESS, NOT AT THE PAYLOAD
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `ainb run` creates every session at 80x24, and THE COMPOSER VIEWPORT IS
// TAIL-ANCHORED: once the content overflows, the head scrolls out of view and
// is not recoverable from the capture. Measured live at 80x24: a 1546-byte
// heartbeat-shaped payload rendered as 7 rows / 382 visible characters with the
// leading `[HEARTBEAT` marker OFF-SCREEN and no placeholder anywhere.
//
// Two consequences drive the whole design:
//
//   1. A needle taken from the payload's HEAD is invisible exactly when the bug
//      fires, so the primary post-send signal is that the composer is CLEAR,
//      and any needle is taken from the payload's TAIL.
//   2. "Clear" has to be DIM-aware. An idle Claude Code renders a dim ghost of
//      the previous prompt inside an EMPTY composer, and a BUSY one renders a
//      dim `Press up to edit queued messages` after it has ACCEPTED the send.
//      In plain `capture-pane -p` both are byte-identical in shape to real
//      typed text; `-e` keeps the `ESC [ 2 m` that tells them apart.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY EVERY SIGNAL IS A CHANGE AGAINST A PRE-WRITE BASELINE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// "Does the composer contain something that looks like my payload" is NOT the
// same question as "did my payload arrive", and answering the first one is how
// the P0 comes back:
//
//   * EVERY ATC heartbeat ends in the same fixed literal, so the last
//     [`NEEDLE_CHARS`] characters of heartbeat N are byte-identical to those of
//     heartbeat N-1. A needle can never tell two of them apart.
//   * Claude Code renders a DIM ghost of the previous prompt inside an EMPTY
//     composer, so a pane that just accepted our text still SHOWS our text.
//   * A human pasting more than one PTY read's worth of characters draws the
//     same `[Pasted text #N]` a machine nudge does.
//
// So the ingest gate captures the composer BEFORE the write and accepts only a
// CHANGE against it: a LIVE (non-dim) occurrence of the needle that was not
// there before, or a paste placeholder that was not there before. Both counts
// are taken from the same [`composer_cells`] rendering, so "dim ghost" and
// "someone else's paste" are subtracted rather than credited to us.
