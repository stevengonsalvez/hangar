//! ABOUTME: End-to-end send-path tests against a REAL tmux pane. Opt-in via
//! `--features tmux-tests` (mirrors ainb-core's flag of the same name) because
//! they need a tmux server on the host.
//!
//! SCOPE, stated honestly. Two kinds of pane are driven here.
//!
//! A bare `cat` pane proves what tmux itself does: the payload reaches the
//! receiving PTY byte for byte with no duplication, concurrent senders are
//! serialised rather than interleaved, and a capture failure is an error rather
//! than a silently-empty pane.
//!
//! A `composer_pane/emulator.py` pane proves what the VERIFY LOOP does. It is
//! not a claude session and does not pretend to be: it models only the three
//! measured properties the send path depends on (a rule-delimited composer, a
//! tail-anchored viewport that scrolls the payload's head out of view, and a
//! target that can swallow the CR). That is enough to make the loop
//! load-bearing here: a target that never submits must be reported as a
//! failure, and a target that does submit must be reported as delivered.
//!
//! What still cannot be covered without a live claude: the paste classifier
//! itself, and the DIM ghost-suggestion/queued-message rendering. Those are
//! pinned by the unit tests in `src/fleet/send/tmux_tests.rs`, which run
//! against verbatim `capture-pane` output from real claude 2.1.224 sessions at
//! both 200x50 and the 80x24 that `ainb run` actually creates.
//!
//! CI SAFETY. `--features tmux-tests` is not the gate CI actually applies: the
//! `Test` job runs `cargo nextest run --workspace --lib --tests --all-features
//!  --no-fail-fast -E 'not binary(/^tripwire_/)'` on ubuntu-latest AND
//! macos-latest, so `--all-features` turns this feature ON and the binary name
//! is not excluded by that filter. Neither runner image ships tmux (the
//! `hangar-e2e` job installs it explicitly, and its own comment records that
//! macOS runner images do not ship it), so every test below MUST skip cleanly
//! rather than panic on a missing binary. Hence [`tmux_available`].
//!
//! ISOLATION, why this file redirects the tmux server, following
//! `ainb-core/tests/resume_command_tmux.rs`. A tmux server exits when its LAST
//! session dies, so a test whose teardown kills its own session can tear the
//! server down under a sibling that is mid-`new-session` (a real CI failure,
//! run 30209167091). Worse on a developer box: without this, the panes below
//! are created on the engineer's live tmux server alongside their real work.
//! Env vars (not `tmux -L`) are the right lever because the library under test
//! shells out to `tmux` itself and targets the DEFAULT socket: env is inherited
//! by those children, a `-L` flag on our own calls would not be. See
//! [`SERVER_SELECTORS`] for why `TMUX_TMPDIR` alone is not enough, and
//! [`panes_live_on_a_private_tmux_server_not_the_ambient_one`] for the assertion
//! that keeps it honest.
