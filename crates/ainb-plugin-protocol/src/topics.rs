//! Reserved snapshot-topic names.
//!
//! Topics are free-form strings on the wire (`host/snapshot/publish`
//! takes any `topic`), but a few names carry host-level semantics.
//! Those live here so the host, the SDK, and in-tree plugins dispatch
//! on byte-identical strings — same rationale as [`crate::methods`].
//!
//! Data-plane topics owned by specific plugins (e.g. the session-reader's
//! `sessions.usage_data`) are NOT listed here; they're plugin contracts,
//! not host contracts.

/// Plugin asks the host to close its focused screen.
///
/// Published by a plugin when it receives an `Esc` it has no internal
/// state left to consume (no zoom, no overlay, no filter chip — its
/// root view). The host's event loop polls this topic by version and
/// navigates back to the screen the panel was opened from.
///
/// Payload: JSON `{"screen_id": "<screen the plugin wants closed>"}`.
/// The host ignores requests whose `screen_id` doesn't match the
/// currently-focused screen, so a stale publish can't close a screen
/// the user has since navigated to.

/// A plugin's view state, for a host that draws the plugin's screen itself.
///
/// Published by a plugin whenever the state its screen shows changes. The

/// the plugin and the renderers that draw it; the host reads it by version
/// and never interprets it.

/// A plugin publishes to [`UI_STATE`]; the runtime stores that under this
