//! Tripwire: Pal chat surface, driven the way an operator drives it.
//!
//! Part 1 shipped a daemon and a CLI and called itself end-to-end proven. It was
//! not: nothing ever opened the TUI, and the Fleet panel was one unmapped token
//! away from rendering every ACP session as `UNKNOWN`. So this drives the REAL
//! `ainb` binary in tmux against a REAL daemon on an isolated socket, opens the
//! chat the way a user does (`f` then `m`, each pressed ONCE), and reads the
//! pane.
//!
//! What is proven against the real daemon here:
//!
//! * the chat surface opens on ONE `m`, resolves its channel through
//!   `fleet/channel_list`, and creates the Pal channel when there is none;
//! * a Pal-authored row and an operator-authored row are DISTINGUISHABLE on
//!   screen, asserted on the row rather than a substring anywhere in the pane;
//! * an open confirm card renders as answerable and `y` resolves it through
//!   `fleet/confirm_answer`, with the store's own row as the receipt.
//!
//! What is NOT proven here, and why:
//!
//! * a card in a state this build cannot decode. `fleet/confirm_list` only
//!   returns `state = 'open'` rows, so an undecodable card cannot be produced
//!   through the daemon at all. That rule is unit-tested where it lives
//!   (`ainb_plugin_hangar::screen::fleet_chat`, `a_card_in_an_unknown_state_*`).
//! * a Pal REPLY. The chat surface addresses a real ACP session, but no
//!   adapter process runs in this test, so
//!   [`the_composer_puts_the_operators_message_in_the_conversation`] proves the
//!   operator's half of that journey: composed, delivered to the channel's own
//!   session, durable and attributed by the daemon.
