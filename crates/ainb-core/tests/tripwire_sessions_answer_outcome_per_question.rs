//! Tripwire: a send's outcome belongs to the QUESTION it answered, and is
//! still there when the operator comes back to it.
//!
//! Two waiting questions. The first is raised on a worktree that TWO live
//! sessions share, and `resolve_and_send_typed` refuses an ambiguous target
//! rather than typing an answer into whichever pane the name happens to hit —
//! so the answer fails for real, through the real refusal, not a stub.
//!
//! A session whose tmux target is gone is not a usable fixture here: discovery
//! filters on `is_running`, so it never reaches the list to be answered.
//!
//! The regression this pins: the `ask` pane held ONE outcome field, cleared on
//! every retarget. Answering the first question and moving to the second threw
//! the failure away, so coming back to the question that failed showed a clean
//! composer and no reason — the answer had simply evaporated. Worse, an outcome
//! that landed while the pane had moved was written to whatever question was on
//! screen, so one session's failure was reported under another's.
//!
//! Driven through the real TUI in tmux and read back off the pane, because
//! that is the only place the lie was visible: every unit of this was green
//! while the surface was reporting the wrong question.
