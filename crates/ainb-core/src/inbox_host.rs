//! The terminal's inbox reader host (D3-prime): section 16 is read for the
//! TUI's whole life, slowly while the inbox screen is not the one open and
//! at the reader's normal cadence while it is, so the unread badge on the
//! session-list legend is live and the open screen is fresh.
//!
//! ```text
//!  launch ──▶ reader at OFF_SCREEN_POLL ──drain──▶ section 16 (badge)
//!  screen opened ──▶ reader at Timing::default().poll, fresh read now
//!  screen left ────▶ back to OFF_SCREEN_POLL; the section is kept
//! ```
//!
//! "Once the daemon is connected" is the reader's own dial: each read dials a
//! fresh client and backs off while the daemon is not there, so the first
//! read that lands is the connection, and until then the section carries the
//! dial's failure as its reason.
