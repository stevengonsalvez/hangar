//! `reference_rust_bin_lib_split`, the dispatch functions live in this library
//! module (reachable as `ainb::cli::hangar::dispatch`) rather than in

// available inside such a home that separates "the daemon this home leaked"
// from "a pid someone wrote into a file", so no pid read out of one may ever
// authorize a signal. A home whose records name a live process is reported,
