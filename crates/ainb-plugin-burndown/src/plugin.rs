//! ABI v2 [`Plugin`] implementation for burndown.
//!
//! `BurndownPlugin` owns the in-memory analytics view + the latest
//! `UsageData` snapshot pushed by the host on the `sessions.usage_data`
//! topic. Render translates the existing ratatui `Buffer` painter into
//! a wire `WireBuffer` cell stream; `cli_dispatch` re-parses argv via
//! clap and falls back to `host.snapshot_get` when no event push has
//! arrived yet.
