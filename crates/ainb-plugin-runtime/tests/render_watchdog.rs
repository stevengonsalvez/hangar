//! The render watchdog: a plugin that blocks inside its own `plugin/render`
//! must not be able to hold the host hostage.
//!
//! `RuntimeConfig::default_render_timeout` existed for a long time without a
//! single reference — nothing enforced it, so a wedged render simply never
//! answered its oneshot. The host went on painting a stale frame, and because
//! the SDK holds one per-plugin mutex across both `render` and the inline
//! `handle_key` dispatch, the plugin's keys stopped being serviced too. That is
//! how pressing `[s]` on the hangar screen made `q` and `Esc` dead.
//!
//! The deliberately-wedging plugin here is the slow fixture in its hold mode: a
//! render requested with [`HOLD_VIEWPORT`] is not answered until the plugin next
//! receives a key. Racing its old 200ms sleep against the budget on the wall
//! clock let a loaded runner deliver the answer first (the task's `select!`
//! reads inbound frames before the deadline arm), so the overrun, and the late
//! answer that lifts the wedge, now happen in an order the test controls
//! (#1133).
