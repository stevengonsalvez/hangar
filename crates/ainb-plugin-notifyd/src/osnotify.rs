//! Native OS notifications (macOS NotificationCenter, Linux libnotify).
//!
//! The daemon calls [`notify`] after persisting an envelope; the call
//! decides — based on the envelope's `raw_event` and a per-
//! `(session_id, raw_event)` debounce — whether to emit a system
//! notification or stay quiet. Telemetry events
//! (`SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` / `PostToolUse`) are never
//! surfaced as OS notifications; only events that indicate "the
//! human is needed" or "the agent is done" qualify.
//!
//! All implementations exit silently on failure — a missing
//! `osascript` / `notify-send` binary, a denied permission, etc.
//! must never break the persist path.
