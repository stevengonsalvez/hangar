//! Discovery + classification of running `notifyd` processes.

//! The daemon's own [`crate::pid`] / [`crate::install::status`] surfaces
//! only know about the single pid recorded in `notify.pid`. That is
//! structurally blind to *orphans* — extra `ainb notifyd` processes left
//! behind by a spawn race or a `brew upgrade` that never bound the socket.
//! This module enumerates every notifyd-family process on the host and
//! classifies each against the canonical owner so the TUI can show — and
//! the user can reap — orphans.
//!
//! Enumeration shells out to `ps` rather than pulling in a process-table
//! crate: it runs only on demand (when the Daemons overlay is open), the
//! two supported targets (macOS, Linux) both ship a `ps` that accepts
//! `-axo pid=,etime=,args=`, and the classification logic — the part worth
//! testing — is a pure function over the parsed rows.
