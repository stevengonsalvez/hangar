//! Transition daemon — materialize `current_state` from the `events` log.
//!
//! agent-deck style: a background loop folds the append-only `events` log
//! into the materialized `current_state` read model, one row per
//! `(session_id, cwd)`. Readers (Wave 4) query `current_state` instead of
//! scanning transcripts/panes on the hot path.
//!
//! # What this module folds (and what it deliberately does NOT)
//!
//! This loop materializes **hook-sourced** state only (`source = "hook"`).
//! `notifyd` intentionally does NOT depend on the heavy `ainb`/`ainb-core`
//! crate (verified: it is absent from `Cargo.toml`), so the tmux / transcript
//! classification path (`first_api_error`, `last_api_error_from_jsonl`, the
//! full `classify()`) — which covers transient in-progress API errors and
//! NON-Claude agents (Codex/Gemini fire no Claude hooks) — lives in the `ainb`
//! crate and is merged at **READ time in Wave 4**: `fleet needs` reads
//! `current_state` for hook-backed sessions and falls back to `classify()`
//! for sessions absent from / stale in `current_state`. Pulling that logic
//! into notifyd would force a new heavy dependency, so option (a) from the
//! plan is taken here. See the Phase 4 reader migration for the fold.
//!
//! # The event → kind state machine (per `(session_id, cwd)`)
//!
//! Events are folded in `seq` order (oldest → newest); the **latest meaningful
//! event sets the state**. The classifier's snapshot priority is
//! `ASK > ERR > WAIT > IDLE`; because we fold an ordered stream rather than
//! evaluate a snapshot, that priority is realised as: a signal event sets its
//! kind, and a *newer* user turn (`UserPromptSubmit` / `SessionStart`) clears
//! it back to `RUNNING`. Concretely the rule is:
//!
//! | event_type · matcher                  | kind   | effect                                   |
//! |---------------------------------------|--------|------------------------------------------|
//! | `SessionStart`                        | `STARTING` | session booting, before the first user turn |
//! | `PreToolUse` · `AskUserQuestion`      | `ASK`  | unanswered interview is the latest signal |
//! | `PermissionRequest`                   | `APPROVE` | tool call awaiting the user's approval    |
//! | `Notification` · `permission_prompt`  | `WAIT` | waiting on the user (permission)          |
//! | `Notification` · `idle_prompt`        | `WAIT` | waiting on the user (idle input prompt)   |
//! | `StopFailure`                         | `ERR`  | API error after retries exhausted         |
//! | `Stop`                                | `IDLE` once `age >= idle_threshold`, else `RUNNING` (turn-ended-but-fresh) |
//! | `UserPromptSubmit`                    | `RUNNING` | a new user turn → clears ASK/WAIT/IDLE/ERR/APPROVE |
//! | `PostToolUse` / `SubagentStart`       | `RUNNING` | active work resumed → clears ASK/WAIT/APPROVE |
//! | `SessionEnd` / legacy `agent-turn-complete` | `DONE` | terminal                             |
//!
//! So the materialized kind is "the latest non-lifecycle signal (ASK/WAIT/ERR),
//! UNLESS a newer user turn reset it to RUNNING, OR a `Stop` aged it into IDLE,
//! OR `SessionEnd` ended it as DONE." This matches `fleet needs`: ASK when an
//! unanswered AskUserQuestion is the latest tool event; ERR when a StopFailure
//! is the newest signal; WAIT when a Notification is the newest; else
//! IDLE-on-age from the last Stop. `Stop` carries no `stop_reason` in
//! Claude Code 2.1.19 (the firing IS turn-end), so IDLE is purely age-driven
//! here — the `stop_reason` null/end_turn nuance stays in the tmux fallback.
//!
//! # IDLE is TIME-driven, not event-driven (the re-sweep)
//!
//! A `Stop` folded while `age < idle_threshold` is written `RUNNING` and would
//! otherwise NEVER become `IDLE` under steady state: the fold is cursor-driven,
//! so with no new event after the Stop, [`events_since`] returns nothing and the
//! pass returns early — the age transition would never fire. To fix that, a
//! freshly-stopped session is written `RUNNING` but with its stop timestamp
//! stamped into `context` as `{"stopped_ts": <ms>}`, and EVERY materialize pass
//! runs a second, TIME-driven [`resweep_idle`] step (independent of the events
//! cursor) that re-scans these stop-pending `RUNNING` rows and promotes any
//! whose `now - stopped_ts >= idle_threshold` to `IDLE` with `idle_minutes`.
//!
//! Readers treat `RUNNING` (with or without a `stopped_ts` marker) as
//! not-a-need, so the marker is invisible to the reader contract — the kind set
//! stays exactly `ASK|ERR|WAIT|IDLE|RUNNING|DONE|STARTING|APPROVE`. Once promoted to `IDLE` the
//! row's context is the classifier-shaped `{"idle_minutes": N}`; a later user
//! turn clears it back to plain `RUNNING` (no marker) via the normal fold.
