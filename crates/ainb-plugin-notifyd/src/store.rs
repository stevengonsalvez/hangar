//! SQLite-backed persistence for notification envelopes.
//!
//! The store owns its own database file (`notifications.db` next to
//! the socket) — not the cache `usage.db` owned by the
//! `ainb-plugin-session-reader` plugin. Two reasons:
//!
//! 1. Concern separation: `notifyd` is a hot writer; `session-reader`
//!    is a batch parser. Sharing one file mixes lifecycles.
//! 2. Schema migrations stay independent: a notifyd schema change
//!    must not risk the session cache.
//!
//! The schema and indexes match the spec's "Data model" section.
