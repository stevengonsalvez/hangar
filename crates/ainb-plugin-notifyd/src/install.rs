//! Install / uninstall / status for the `ainb-hooks` plugin.
//!
//! The bash hook script and Claude plugin manifest are embedded into
//! the `ainb-notifyd` binary at build time via `include_str!`. The
//! [`install`] verb extracts them to known on-disk locations and
//! wires Claude Code, Codex CLI, and GitHub Copilot CLI to call into `notify.sh`.
//!
//! For Claude: the `claude plugin` marketplace CLI installs
//! `ainb-hooks@agents-in-a-box`, so Claude resolves the plugin root and
//! bundled `hooks/notify.sh` itself.
//!
//! For Codex: a managed JSON block in `~/.codex/hooks.json`, since
//! Codex resolves hook commands as absolute paths. The block points
//! at the canonical `~/.agents-in-a-box/hooks/notify.sh` so the
//! plugin stays agent-agnostic per Stevie's constraint.
//!
//! For Copilot: a standalone drop-in at `~/.copilot/hooks/ainb.json`,
//! because Copilot combines every hook file in that directory.
//!
//! Install state is recorded at `~/.agents-in-a-box/install.json` so
//! [`uninstall`] is fully reversible.
