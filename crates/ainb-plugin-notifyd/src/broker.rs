//! The approve/deny broker — a synchronous permission round-trip.
//!
//! Unlike the notify socket ([`crate::paths::Paths::socket`]), which is
//! one-way fire-and-forget, the broker listens on a *request/response*
//! socket ([`crate::paths::Paths::approve_socket`]). It exists to close
//! the one gap where AgentPeek's design beats ours: a human synchronously
//! approving or denying a live Claude `PermissionRequest` hook.
//!
//! Five line-JSON operations, one per connection:
//!
//! - **AWAIT**: a waiting hook (the `ainb fleet atc hook`
//!   `PermissionRequest` branch) dials in, registers itself keyed by
//!   `session_id`, and BLOCKS on the connection until a human decides or
//!   the broker times out. The response is the decision.
//! - **DECIDE**: the fleet TUI / CLI dials in, names a `session_id` and
//!   an `approve`/`deny`, the broker hands the decision to the blocked
//!   AWAIT, and both connections resolve.
//! - **AWAIT_STRUCTURED**: a managed AskUserQuestion hook registers its exact
//!   fingerprint and complete question array, then blocks for answers.
//! - **ANSWER_STRUCTURED**: an operator answers every question. The broker
//!   accepts only the current fingerprint and only the first valid answer.
//! - **LIST**: dump pending requests, including structured questions and their
//!   current fingerprint, for Fleet surfaces.
//!
//! ## Durability model
//!
//! Pending approvals live ONLY in memory. Waiters re-dial and re-send
//! AWAIT on disconnect, so restarting notifyd is the single resume
//! command: every still-alive waiter re-registers itself. There is no
//! durable pending file. If a waiter's AWAIT times out (no human in the
//! window) the permission fallback is **deny**, never auto-approve. Permission
//! requests correlate by `session_id`. Structured requests additionally require
//! the exact fingerprint so a late answer cannot resolve a newer prompt.
//!
//! ## Trust boundary
//!
//! The socket is chmod `0600`, so other users are excluded — but every
//! process running as the SAME uid can DECIDE, including the supervised
//! agents themselves (an agent with any pre-approved shell access could
//! self-approve by writing one JSON line). This is the same trust
//! boundary as the pre-existing tmux `send-keys` surface: the broker
//! gates *remote/UI* approval, it is not a sandbox against a hostile
//! local process. Do not treat an `allow` from this broker as proof a
//! HUMAN clicked it if same-uid code is untrusted.
