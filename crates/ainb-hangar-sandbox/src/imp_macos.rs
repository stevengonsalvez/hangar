//! macOS Seatbelt backend: confine the provider via `/usr/bin/sandbox-exec`.
//!
//! We generate a Sandbox Profile Language (SBPL / `.sb`) document that
//! `(import "bsd.sb")`s the system base profile (so a dynamically-linked binary
//! and the dyld shared cache can load — without this every exec aborts with
//! `Abort trap: 6` before `main`), then `(deny default)`s every operation and
//! re-allows the narrow set a real agent needs:
//!
//! - `process-exec*` / `process-fork` so the program (and tools it shells out
//!   to) can run,
//! - `file-read*` on the policy read roots — so the agent can read its own
//!   inputs but NOT the operator's `$HOME`/`~/.ssh`/`~/.aws` (verified: under
//!   `bsd.sb` + `(deny default)`, reading a file in the real home is blocked
//!   with `Operation not permitted`),
//! - `file-write*` on the policy write roots (the task workdir/output/logs +
//!   temp) only — every other write is denied,
//! - `network*` when [`SandboxPolicy::allow_network`] (the agent must reach the
//!   model API).
//!
//! `bsd.sb` grants broad *system* reads (libs, frameworks) — those are
//! world-readable system content, never user secrets — so it widens nothing
//! that matters while making real binaries actually runnable.
//!
//! The profile is passed **inline** via `sandbox-exec -p '<profile>'` (not a
//! `-f <file>`): an inline profile has no temp-file lifetime to manage, so there
//! is no race where the profile is deleted before `sandbox-exec` reads it (a
//! `-f` file deleted right after `tokio::spawn()` returns makes `sandbox-exec`
//! exit 65 "No such file or directory"). No `unsafe` is used — `sandbox-exec`
//! is an external launcher.
