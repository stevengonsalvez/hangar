//! Parse the PR URL `gh pr create` prints to stdout (P9.1).
//!
//! v1 GitHub integration is `gh`-CLI-only (no App, no webhook): an agent that
//! shells out to `gh pr create` inside its worktree prints the created PR's URL
//! on its own line. Each executor runs [`parse_gh_pr_create_stdout`] over
//! whatever it captured of that output, to stamp
//! `agent_task_queue.result.pr_url` (see [`crate::result::TaskResult`]) so the
//! TUI can surface the PR: the process executor over the agent's stdout (a
//! bounded ring buffer), the ACP executor over its own transcript, because an
//! adapter's stdout is the JSON-RPC pipe and carries no agent output at all.
//!
//! Which is why the whole-line anchoring below is a contract and not a detail:
//! both corpora interleave the URL with prose, and only "on a line of its own"
//! separates a PR that was CREATED from one merely mentioned.
//!
//! # What counts as a match
//!
//! Exactly a *canonical* PR URL on its own (whitespace-trimmed) line:
//! `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/<n>`. The pattern is **anchored to
//! the whole line** (`^…$`) on purpose:
//! - a `gh pr list` table row, an issue URL (`/issues/N`), a sub-path
//!   (`/pull/N/files`), or the URL quoted mid-sentence all fail to match, so
//!   prose / error text / other `gh` verbs are never misread as a created PR.
//!
//! # Multi-PR runs
//!
//! When several canonical PR URL lines appear (an agent that opened more than
//! one PR), the **last** one is returned — most-recent intent.
