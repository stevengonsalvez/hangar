//! Hangar domain core: pure, IO-free types shared across the managed-agents
//! control plane.
//!
//! This crate carries the vocabulary of the Hangar domain — polymorphic
//! actors, strongly-typed IDs, the task-status lifecycle enum, and the
//! clock / id-generation injection seams — with **no IO dependencies** (no
//! `tokio`, `sqlx`, or `ratatui`). The persistence layer
//! ([`ainb_hangar_store`](../ainb_hangar_store/index.html)) and the daemon both
//! depend on it, never the other way around.
