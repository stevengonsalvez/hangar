//! The task lifecycle finite-state machine ([`TaskState`]).
//!
//! Mirrors the reference `agent_task_queue.status` column verbatim:
//! `queued -> dispatched -> running -> done | failed | cancelled`
//! (`001_init.up.sql:132`). The serde and database string forms are both the
//! lowercase token so the JSON wire representation is byte-identical to the
//! `TEXT` value persisted by [`ainb_hangar_store`](../../../ainb_hangar_store/index.html).
//!
//! Unlike the P0 placeholder [`crate::task_status::TaskStatus`], this type owns
//! the legal-transition table and the [`TaskState::can_transition_to`] guard
//! the P1.2-P1.5 FSM services build on. No state-string literals should appear
//! anywhere outside this module.
