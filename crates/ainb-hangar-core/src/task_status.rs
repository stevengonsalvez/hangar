//! The task lifecycle status enum.
//!
//! Mirrors the `status` `CHECK` constraint on `agent_task_queue`:
//! `queued -> dispatched -> running -> done | failed | cancelled`. The serde
//! wire form is snake_case so the JSON representation is byte-identical to the
//! `TEXT` values stored by the persistence layer and carried over the RPC wire.
//!
//! P0 only ever writes [`TaskStatus::Queued`]; the typed state transitions land
//! in P1.
