//! Socket-connection authentication for the daemon's RPC server (e38.1).
//!
//! Two layers gate every accepted connection before any `hangar/*` method is
//! reachable:
//!
//! 1. **Same-uid peer credentials** — the kernel-reported peer uid must match
//!    the daemon's own uid ([`same_uid_peer`]). `tokio`'s
//!    [`peer_cred`](tokio::net::UnixStream::peer_cred) reads `SO_PEERCRED` on
//!    Linux and `LOCAL_PEERCRED`/`getpeereid` on macOS, so both cfg paths are
//!    covered by the one call.
//! 2. **First-frame token auth** — the first decoded frame must be an
//!    `auth/hello` request ([`ainb_hangar_proto::auth`]) whose token verifies
//!    against the stored digest through the constant-time
//!    [`ainb_hangar_core::token::verify`] seam
//!    ([`SocketTokenRepo::verify`]). Anything else is answered with an
//!    [`UNAUTHORIZED`](ainb_hangar_proto::auth::UNAUTHORIZED) error and the
//!    connection is closed.
//!
//! ## Token lifecycle
//!
//! [`ensure_socket_token`] runs at boot, **before** the socket binds: when the
//! stored digest and the on-disk plaintext agree, the credential is reused;
//! otherwise a fresh `mdt_…` token is minted (CSPRNG), only its SHA-256 hex
//! digest is persisted (`daemon_socket_token`, migration 0011), and the
//! plaintext is written exactly once to `{hangar_home}/hangar/daemon.token`
//! with `0600` permissions. Clients (the hangar-tui plugin, test harnesses)
//! read that file and present it on their first frame.
