//! Generic mutation dedupe at dispatch, and the receipt claim underneath it
//! (spec D18, critique amendments 15-19).
//!
//! Every mutating method passes through here on its way to its handler, so the
//! guarantee is a property of the DISPATCHER rather than of ~96 hand-written
//! transactions:
//!
//! ```text
//! request ──▶ op id? ─no─▶ handler (today's behaviour, no ledger row)
//!               │yes
//!               ▼
//!          claim (host, principal, op_id)
//!               ├─ foreign      ──▶ rejected{op_id_foreign}
//!               ├─ other body   ──▶ rejected{already_answered_by}
//!               ├─ expired      ──▶ unknown{op_expired}
//!               ├─ in flight    ──▶ unknown{effects_ambiguous} + receipt state
//!               ├─ committed    ──▶ the stored reply, verbatim
//!               └─ fresh        ──▶ handler ──▶ record the reply
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why the reply is stored and not recomputed
//!
//! The retry exists because the FIRST reply was lost. Recomputing it would mean
//! running the handler again, which is the thing the ledger exists to prevent.
//! So the serialized reply is the ledger's payload, and a replay is a read.
//!
//! ## Which failures are recorded
//!
//! Everything deterministic, including `INVALID_PARAMS`: the same op id with
//! the same body gets the same answer, and a client that fixes its params is
//! sending a different body, which the fingerprint catches. Only `SQLite`
//! contention and internal faults ABANDON the claim, because those are exactly
//! the cases where the caller is supposed to retry and get a different answer.
