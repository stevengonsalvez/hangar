/// from retirement forever, because the sweep consults the union of both.
///
/// # Why `last_observed_at` may not lead
///
/// It used to, and that is the bug this ordering exists to fix. Every write the
/// daemon makes bumps it (`apply_event_in_tx` does
/// `last_observed_at.max(observed_at)` on any applied event), including the two
/// writes that mean the OPPOSITE of "this row is alive": the missing-sweep's
/// `tmux_missing` and the reaper's `session_stale`. Meanwhile a live row in its
/// steady state emits nothing at all, because `tmux_transport_settled` exists
/// precisely to stop it, so its `last_observed_at` is FROZEN. One sweep is
/// therefore enough to put a retired ghost strictly AHEAD of the live row that
/// owns the pane. The ghost then took the binding, was restored to HEALTHY, and
/// `reap_stale_sessions` (which skips anything not UNAVAILABLE) could never
/// retire it again: a permanent ghost advertising an attachable pane that
/// belongs to somebody else, which is the exact outcome the one-owner-per-pane
/// rule was added to prevent. When the two rows happen to be written on the same
/// tick it degrades instead into a TIE, which fell through to snapshot order
/// (`SESSION_SELECT_ALL` is `ORDER BY session_key ASC`) and inverted ownership
/// for good the moment the ghost's key sorted first.
///
/// So the fields that say WHAT KIND of row this is are consulted first, and the
/// timestamps only separate rows of equal standing:
///
/// 1. Not EXITED. A retired row must never hold a live pane. It cannot even use
///    the binding ([`restore_tmux_transport`] refuses to restore an EXITED row),
///    so letting it win only denies the claim to the row that can.
/// 2. MANAGED. [`pane_owners`] resolves discovered panes onto MANAGED rows and
///    considers NOTHING else, so preferring them here is the only ordering under
///    which the two passes can agree; and it is the inferred scanner row, not
///    the hook row, that can never carry interview actions.
/// 3. `last_observed_at`, newest first: among rows of the same standing a pane
///    holds a succession of provider sessions over time, and the live one is the
///    one observed most recently.
/// 4. `discovered_at`, newest first, for the same reason. Written once by
///    `new_session` and never patched (`update_session` binds the row's own
///    value straight back), so unlike (3) no sweep can move it.
/// 5. `session_key`, which makes the order TOTAL. Without it two otherwise equal
///    rows tie, and the two call shapes break ties in opposite directions:
///    `Iterator::max_by_key` keeps the LAST maximum while the `>=` loop below
///    keeps the FIRST. A tie is therefore not merely arbitrary, it is a
