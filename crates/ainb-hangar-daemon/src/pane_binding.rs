// ABOUTME: Daemon-side pane binding for hook-sourced Fleet rows (spec D14,
// issue #916). Resolves which tmux pane a managed session occupies when the
// hook process could not tell us itself.
//
// Tier-0 identity never rides on launcher environment. A provider may run its
// hooks from a long-lived shared daemon whose environment predates the pane:
// Codex 0.154 attaches the interactive TUI to a shared app-server, so the hook
// process inherits that daemon's environment and `$TMUX_PANE` is absent. The
// `session_id` and `cwd` in the payload still identify the session, so the
// store key survives; what is lost is the pane.
//
// A null `tmux_target` is not cosmetic. It skips legacy-row retirement
// (`fleet::retire_correlated_legacy`), so one agent shows as two rows, a
// tier-5 discovered pane row and a tier-0 hook row, and it strips the exact
// target the send-keys answer path needs. Measured on the ainb-owned
// app-server: 1,215 of 1,215 sampled hook lines carried a null target.
//
// The daemon can recover the pane the hook could not name, because it already
// holds the tier-5 discovery scan. Correlate `(provider, cwd)` against the
// discovered panes running that provider in that directory and bind when
// EXACTLY ONE matches. Zero or two is not a coin toss: binding the wrong pane
// types an answer into an agent that never asked, so an unresolved row stays
// `pane_unbound` and says so, on the fleet panel and in `ainb doctor`.
