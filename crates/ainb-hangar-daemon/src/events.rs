//! The daemon's in-process event broker — the producer half of the
//! dual-channel design (e38.2).
//!
//! [`ainb_hangar_proto::events`] has carried the typed [`HangarEvent`] wire
//! contract since P3, and the plugin's `StreamClient` fully decodes
//! `hangar/event` notification frames — but until e38.2 the daemon had zero
//! emission sites, so live UI was snapshot-pull only. This module closes the
//! gap:
//!
//! - Mutation paths (the claim loop's FSM finalize, the RPC `task_transition`
//!   handler, the autopilot scheduler / fire-now path) hold an [`EventSink`]
//!   and call [`EventSink::emit`] with the owning workspace's **real row id**
//!   after each state change commits.
//! - The RPC server registers each authenticated, subscribed connection as a
//!   workspace-scoped consumer ([`EventBroker::subscribe`]); a per-connection
//!   forwarder filters [`ScopedEvent`]s to the subscription's workspace and
//!   frames matching events as JSON-RPC *notifications* (`{jsonrpc, method,
//!   params}`, no `id`) in the same Content-Length envelope responses use.
//!
//! ## Delivery semantics
//!
//! Best-effort, at-most-once: the broker is a [`tokio::sync::broadcast`]
//! channel, so emission never blocks a mutation path (no subscribers → the
//! send is dropped) and a slow consumer that lags past the channel capacity
//! loses the oldest events rather than back-pressuring the daemon. That is the
//! designed contract — the plugin treats events as instant feedback and the
//! next snapshot pull reconciles authoritatively, so a dropped event
//! self-heals.
//!
//! ## Scoping invariant
//!
//! Every [`ScopedEvent::workspace_id`] and every subscription's workspace are
//! the **resolved row id** (never the wire slug), so the equality filter in the
//! connection forwarder is exact: events for workspace A can never reach a
//! connection subscribed to workspace B.
