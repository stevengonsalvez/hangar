//! In-memory daemon health stats: the rolling task-throughput ring buffer + the
//! bounded claim-slot cache figure (P8.5).
//!
//! The daemon-health pane (`hangar/daemon_health`, the `D` screen) needs two
//! pieces of state the persistent store does not hold: a **per-second rolling
//! window** of how many tasks finished (split success / failure), and the
//! current occupancy of the bounded claim-slot cache. Both are view-layer
//! figures — this is deliberately a tiny snapshot collector, **not** a metrics
//! system; nothing here is persisted.
//!
//! ## Throughput ring
//!
//! [`HealthStats`] holds a fixed [`THROUGHPUT_WINDOW`]-slot ring of
//! per-second `(completed, failed)` tallies. The FSM finalize path
//! ([`crate::run_loop`]) calls [`HealthStats::record_completed`] /
//! [`HealthStats::record_failed`] with the current epoch-second as each task
//! reaches a terminal state. The ring **rolls on the second boundary**: when a
//! record lands on a newer second than the ring's head, the head advances one
//! slot per elapsed second (zero-filling any idle seconds in between) so the
//! window always covers exactly the last minute relative to the latest
//! activity.
//!
//! [`HealthStats::snapshot`] renders the ring oldest-first against a caller-
//! supplied "now" second, so a snapshot taken in a quiet period still shows the
//! window sliding forward (the trailing buckets read zero).
//!
//! ## Concurrency
//!
//! The daemon runs the FSM finalize path and the RPC dispatcher on different
//! tasks, so the collector is shared as `Arc<HealthStats>` and guards its ring
//! behind a `Mutex`. The critical sections are O(window) and contention-free in
//! practice (finalize is not a hot loop).
