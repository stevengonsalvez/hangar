//! Clap surface for `ainb hangar beads reconcile` (P2.5).
//!
//! This is the parse layer only — it defines the `beads` subgroup, its
//! `reconcile` verb, and the flags (`--dry-run`, repeated `--label`,
//! `--format`). The verb's options round-trip into [`ReconcileOpts`] via
//! [`ReconcileArgs::to_opts`]; the daemon's dispatcher composes a
//! [`ReconcileService`](super::ReconcileService), runs it, and renders the
//! [`ReconcileReport`](super::ReconcileReport) in the chosen [`OutputFormat`].
//!
//! Keeping the clap types here (rather than in `main.rs`) means the surface is
//! unit-testable without spawning the binary and stays composable into the host
//! `ainb hangar` command tree.
