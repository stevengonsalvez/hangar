//! Inbound beads sync poll loop (P2.4).
//!
//! [`run_inbound_loop`] drives [`InboundSync::reconcile_once`] on a fixed
//! interval until cancelled. It is the long-lived daemon task that keeps Hangar
//! issues in step with `bd`-side status changes.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! - Spawned as a named `JoinHandle` by the daemon's supervisor (restart-safe).
//! - Selects on a [`CancellationToken`] every tick so shutdown is honoured
//!   within one sleep (no blocking on the next reconcile).
//! - **Backs off on failure.** A failing `bd list` (binary missing, non-zero
//!   exit) is non-fatal: the loop logs, doubles its delay up to a 5-minute cap,
//!   and keeps trying. A success resets the delay to the base interval.
//!
//! The module name is `sync_loop` rather than `loop` because `loop` is a Rust
//! keyword and cannot be a module identifier.

///
/// On a successful reconcile the next delay resets to `interval`. On a failure
/// the delay doubles, clamped to [`MAX_BACKOFF`], so a persistently broken `bd`
/// does not hammer the binary. The loop checks `cancel` at the head of every
/// tick, so a cancellation is honoured within at most one current delay.
///
/// `'static` lifetimes on the [`InboundSync`] let the loop own its dependencies
/// across `await` points when held behind the supervisor's `Arc`.
