//! Beads → Hangar inbound mirror (P2.4).
//!
//! [`InboundSync`] pulls the current state of Stevie's `bd` tracker and lands any
//! `bd`-side status change on the mirrored Hangar issue. It is the read half of
//! the two-way sync: where [`outbound`](super::outbound) pushes Hangar lifecycle
//! changes out to `bd`, this reconciles `bd`'s view back into Hangar.
//!
//! # Contract
//!
//! - **Scoped by mapping.** Only `bd` issues with a [`beads_mapping`] row are
//!   reconciled; a `bd` issue with no mapping is out-of-scope and skipped
//!   (logged at DEBUG) — Hangar does not adopt arbitrary `bd` issues here (that
//!   is the reconcile command's job in P2.5).
//! - **Source-gated.** A [`MappingSource::Swarm`] row is owned by a swarm
//!   leader's `bd` lifecycle (per `feedback_swarm_leader_owns_bd_tracking`) and
//!   is skipped — inbound reconciles only `Hangar`-sourced mappings.
//! - **Status only, last-writer-wins per field.** Labels and other `bd` fields
//!   are advisory; inbound touches only the Hangar issue's lifecycle `state`.
//! - **Idempotent.** A tick where `bd`'s status already matches Hangar produces
//!   no write (`updated == 0`), so the poll loop is safe to run every interval.
//!
//! The adapter holds borrows (`bd`, `mapping`, `pool`, `clock`) so the daemon
//! composes it per-operation from its long-lived service registry; it is
//! `Send + Sync`.
//!
