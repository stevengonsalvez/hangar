//! Cross-process pidfile lock for serialising `bd` writes (P2.2).
//!
//! `bd` mutates a git-backed store; two concurrent writes against the same
//! `BEADS_DIR` can race on the git head. Cargo runs integration test binaries in
//! parallel processes, so an in-process `Mutex` is not enough — serialization
//! must span processes. [`BdLock`] uses a pidfile as the token: whoever
//! publishes the file holds the lock; everyone else spins until it disappears.
//! A crashed holder leaves a stale file, so a contender whose PID is no longer
//! alive (`kill(pid, 0)` → `ESRCH`) steals the lock by removing it. Mirrors the
//! project's `reference_cross_process_test_serialization` pattern.
//!
//! **Publication is atomic, and must stay that way.** The pidfile is written to
//! a private temp file first and only then linked into place with `hard_link`,
//! which is atomic and fails with `EEXIST` while the lock is held. The naive
//! `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` + `write!` sequence is *not* safe here: between the create
//! and the write the pidfile exists but is empty, and an empty pidfile is
//! indistinguishable from the one a crashed holder leaves behind. A contender
//! sampling that window takes the crash-recovery path, deletes a *live* holder's
//! pidfile and acquires alongside it — two holders, two concurrent `bd`
//! processes, the git-head race the lock exists to prevent.
//!
//! **An absent pidfile is not stale, it is free.** Atomic publication closed the
//! empty-file window but not the second route to the same double-hold: the
//! crash-recovery path decided "stale" from a *failed read*, then unlinked the
//! path. Absent reads that way too, and between that read and the unlink another
//! contender can publish — so the unlink deletes a brand-new live holder's
//! pidfile and the stealer acquires alongside it. Removal must therefore be
//! driven by what the file SAYS (a dead PID, or unusable content), never by the
//! read merely failing. [`PidfileRead`] keeps the two apart.
//!
//! **Judging a file stale and reclaiming it must be ONE step.** Even reading a
//! genuinely dead PID is not enough to justify an unlink: two contenders can
//! sample the SAME stale pidfile, both conclude "crashed", and both remove it —
//! the first republishes, and the second's unlink deletes that brand-new live
//! holder's pidfile. Third route, same double-hold. [`BdLock::steal_atomically`]
//! therefore reclaims with `rename`, which is winner-take-all: only one caller
//! can move a given inode aside, and every loser simply retries.
