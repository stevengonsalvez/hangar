//! Test fixtures: a fake `bd` binary as a shell script (P2.2 REFACTOR).
//!
//! The P2.2 adapter tests — and the outbound/inbound sync tests in P2.3+ — drive
//! [`super::BdClient`] against a tiny shell-script stand-in for the real `bd`
//! rather than the live binary, so the suite is hermetic and fast. This module
//! centralises the script writer so every test file uses one source of truth for
//! the fake's wire shape.
//!
//! # Wire shape fidelity
//!
//! The fixtures mirror `bd 0.49.0`'s **per-verb** JSON shape, because the adapter
//! parses each shape differently:
//!
//! - `bd create` emits a bare JSON **object** (`{...}`), with no `labels` field.
//! - `bd close`/`bd list`/`bd show` emit a JSON **array** (`[{...}]`).
//!
//! A fixture that wrapped `create` output in `[...]` (as an earlier revision did)
//! would mask a guaranteed runtime parse failure against the real binary, so the
//! object/array split here is load-bearing — keep it aligned with reality.
//!
//! Gated on `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "test-support"))]`: available to this
//! crate's own unit tests, and to downstream integration tests that enable the
//! `test-support` feature (integration tests do not inherit `#[cfg(test)]`).
