//! `fleet/acp_session_create` and a task caller need the same two writes: mint
//! the `fleet_session` + `fleet_acp_session` PAIR for a scope, and put a prompt
//! on the bus with its PENDING delivery leg. Each is ONE transaction here and
//! both doors call it, so the RPC and a task cannot drift into two slightly
//! different rows for the same thing. Neither spawns anything: the pool starts
//! the adapter lazily on the first prompt, so a session that never receives a
//! message costs nothing but a row.
