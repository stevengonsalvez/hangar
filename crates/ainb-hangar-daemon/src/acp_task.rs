//!
//! Two shapes here are load-bearing and are not preferences.
//!
//! **The leg is polled, never awaited.** The pool resolves the PENDING delivery
//! leg in one transaction on turn end, on adapter exit, on the deadline sweep
//! and on boot convergence ([`crate::acp_pool`]), so it is the one signal that

//! missed send would freeze the task at `running` until the multi-hour TTL:
//! the exact black hole `execute_claimed`'s spawn-setup umbrella exists to
//! close.
//!
//! **The adapter process is per TASK, not the shared pool's.** The permission
//! mode, the child environment and the OS sandbox are all per PROCESS
//! ([`ainb_acp::config::AdapterConfig`]), so a shared `claude-agent-acp` cannot
//! host one task's `agent_env` without handing it to every other tenant, and
//! its `max_in_flight_per_process: 4` would cap the whole fleet's concurrent
//! task turns at four.
