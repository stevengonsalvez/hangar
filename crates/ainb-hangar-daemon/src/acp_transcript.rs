//! One ACP session's transcript, live and durable, behind one door.
//!
//! This module exists for its PRIVACY, not for its size. `StoreWriter` is a
//! field of [`TranscriptSink`] and nothing outside this file can name it, so
//! `acp_pool` cannot write through the STORE WRITER without publishing live
//! first. A doc comment on the field would not do that: Rust privacy is
//! per-MODULE, so a sign on the door inside `acp_pool.rs` is a sign, and the
//! same omission had already walked past it twice.
//!
//! # The guarantee, in terms you can check in one grep
//!
//! `AcpClassifier::classify_value` renders exactly NINE `event_type` tokens and
//! drops everything else, so a row can only diverge live-from-durable if
//! something minted one of those nine. **Every minter of those nine is behind
//! this module**: the reducer's seven reach the ledger only through
//! [`TranscriptSink::chunk`], the lifecycle markers only through
//! [`TranscriptSink::lifecycle`], and the one caller that appends straight to
//! the ledger goes through [`append_and_publish`].
//!
//! Counting WRITE SITES is what made seven successive counts wrong: that set is
//! unbounded and grows with the code. Counting TOKEN MINTERS bounds it, because
//! the token set is nine strings in one `match`.
//!
//! One exception, and it is unfixable by design rather than an oversight:
//! `acp.transcript_truncated` is minted INSIDE `StoreWriter::enforce_buffer_cap`,
//! below the layer that knows a stream exists, so it reaches durable without
//! streaming. That is the same buffer-overflow window the live-before-durable
//! ordering already qualifies the equality with, from the other side.

/// lines the operator never saw stream — and that omission has now been written
/// twice, both times by someone adding a perfectly legitimate new flush (the
/// turn-end one, then the adapter-death drain). A doc comment did not stop the
/// second. Here the only ways in are [`Self::chunk`] and [`Self::lifecycle`],
/// both of which publish before they write, so a third flush cannot compile
/// without going through one of them.
///
/// Live is published BEFORE the durable commit, deliberately: the writer
/// buffers and commits on a cadence, so publishing after would hold the
/// operator's view back by up to a flush interval. See the module docs for the
