//! Hourly retention sweep over the `fleet_event` ledger.
//!
//! Three stages, run in order, each batched:
//!
//! * **A — payload eviction at 48h.** Blanks aged hook bodies, keeps the rows.
//! * **B — row delete at 30 days.** Removes whole rows, guarded.
//! * **C — byte ceiling.** Re-runs A on progressively tighter cutoffs while the
//!   corpus is over budget.
//!
//! C is a CO-EQUAL control, not a backstop. The measured corpus is rate-driven:
//! 713 MB of 714 MB was under seven days old, at roughly 102 MB/day. An age
//! cutoff alone therefore bounds nothing — it fixes the WINDOW and lets the
//! rate pick the size. A seven-day cutoff would have held ~713 MB steady, which
//! is the problem; 48h holds ~204 MB; and if the rate doubles, only C reacts.
//!
//! Scheduling notes are load-bearing. `SQLite` has ONE writer, shared with the
//! Fleet reconciler and the ACP transcript writer (see
//! `ainb_hangar_store::repo::fleet_provider_event`'s own warning about that
//! contention). So this runs on its own task, never the 3s tick, with bounded
//! batches, a yield and a WAL checkpoint between them, and its sleep taken
//! AFTER the work rather than on a ticker.
//!
//! ## Backlog catch-up vs steady state
//!
//! These are the same code on two different clocks, because the only thing that
//! differs is how much is left to do. A pass evicts at most
//! [`MAX_ROWS_PER_PASS`] rows; if it hits that cap there is more backlog, and
//! the next pass follows in [`CATCHUP_PERIOD`] instead of [`SWEEP_PERIOD`].
//!
//! Measured reason the cap exists: the first production pass against the
//! un-swept 1.4 GB database peaked the daemon at **2,599 MB RSS** (204 MB
//! steady state) with CPU at 106%. Nothing was leaking — it drained back down —
//! but an unbounded first pass rewrites ~700 MB of payload in one continuous
//! burst, and a WAL only shrinks at a checkpoint the automatic checkpointer
//! never gets to run. The cap plus [`FleetRetentionRepo::checkpoint_wal`]
//! bounds bytes-in-flight per pass instead of per backlog.
//!
//! ## Resumability
//!
//! There is NO watermark to persist, because the tombstone already is one, and
//! a better one. `payload_evicted_at` is a per-row durable checkpoint written
//! in the same transaction as the eviction it records, and the sweep selects
//! through the `payload_evicted_at IS NULL` partial index — so a daemon killed
//! mid-backlog resumes exactly where it stopped, with no in-memory state, no
//! scalar cursor that can disagree with the rows, and no extra migration.
//! `evicted_backlog_resumes_from_the_tombstone_after_a_restart` proves that
//! across a real pool close and reopen.
