//! Per-run working-directory provisioning from a card's `repo_ref` (spec F5).
//!
//! At dispatch a card's task carries a `repo_ref` (migration 0032): an absolute
//! path to a git repo, or the literal `scratch`. This module turns that into the
//! run's actual working directory, mirroring the New-Session `WorktreeManager`
//! contract (`ainb-core/src/git/worktree_manager.rs`) but implemented daemon-side
//! (the daemon cannot depend on ainb-core — the crate cycle) by shelling out to
//! the real `git` binary, exactly as [`crate::worktree`] does:
//!
//! ```text
//!  repo_ref = Some("/path/to/repo")  ──▶  volatile worktree
//!                                          <home>/.agents-in-a-box/worktrees/<slug>
//!                                          on branch  ainb/<slug>
//!                                          torn down on completion, KEPT if dirty
//!  repo_ref = Some("scratch")        ──▶  <home>/.agents-in-a-box/scratch/<scratch_slug>
//!                                          `git init` (idempotent), run IN PLACE
//!                                          (already isolated — never torn down)
//!  repo_ref = None                   ──▶  the fallback execenv workdir (a chat /
//!                                          autopilot task — the pre-F5 behaviour)
//! ```
//!
//! # Two slugs: per-RUN worktree vs per-CARD scratch
//!
//! The `slug` is the caller's per-task key (the FULL task id, tcp vpm). Because it
//! is unique per task, two cards launched on the SAME repo provision two DISTINCT
//! worktrees on two DISTINCT `ainb/<slug>` branches — they never collide (the F5
//! "N tasks on one repo never collide" guarantee, now airtight: no truncated prefix
//! can alias two ids).
//!
//! Scratch is different: it is the card's durable scratch space (F2 intent), so it
//! is keyed on the caller's `scratch_slug` — a per-(card, agent) key, STABLE across
//! reruns and DISTINCT per concurrent squad member. A per-run slug would hand every
//! rerun a fresh empty dir, silently losing the prior run's scratch work; the
//! (card, agent) slug reuses the same `scratch/<scratch_slug>` dir so a rerun
//! continues where the last run left off, while a squad fan-out — whose members
//! share the issue but hold distinct agents — still gets a dir per member and never
//! races two runs in one working tree.
//!
//! # Teardown (keep-if-dirty)
//!
//! [`teardown`] removes a clean worktree (and deregisters it from the origin
//! repo) but KEEPS a dirty one — an agent that left uncommitted work does not
//! lose it. Scratch + fallback are never torn down (scratch is durable by design;
//! the fallback is the execenv the GC sweeper owns).
