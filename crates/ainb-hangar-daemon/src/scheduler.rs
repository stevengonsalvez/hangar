//! The autopilot scheduler thread + tick loop (P7.3).
//!
//! A single long-lived tokio task that drives every enabled, cron-scheduled
//! [`Autopilot`] across all workspaces. It is the daemon-global counterpart to
//! the per-workspace [`ainb_hangar_core::autopilot::service::AutopilotService`]:
//! the service answers RPC reads/mutations for one tenant; this loop fires the
//! whole fleet on time.
//!
//! # Loop shape
//!
//! ```text
//! ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
//! │ pick earliest│───▶│ sleep_until tick │───▶│ fire enqueue │
//! │ next_tick_at │    │  OR shutdown     │    │ + reschedule │
//! └──────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └──────┬───────┘
//!        ▲                                            │
//!        └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! Each iteration: read the enabled autopilots (`next_tick_at IS NOT NULL`),
//! pick the one firing soonest, sleep until that instant **or** the
//! [`CancellationToken`] trips, then — re-checking the concurrency limit *at
//! fire time* — either fire or record a skip (both through the store's shared
//! [`dispatch_with_admission`] admission gate), and in both cases
//! recompute and persist the next `next_tick_at`. With no enabled autopilots the
//! loop re-polls after [`NO_WORK_REPOLL`].
//!
//! # Why recompute from the *fired tick*, not `clock.now()`
//!
//! The next tick is computed strictly after the tick that just fired
//! ([`recompute_next_tick`]), never reseeded from a possibly-late `clock.now()`.
//! Computing from `now` after a slow fire could skip the very next slot (drift);
//! computing from the fired tick keeps the cadence exact. The one nuance: if a
//! daemon was down long enough that the recomputed next tick is *still* in the
//! past, [`recompute_next_tick`] advances forward from `now` so the loop fires
//! one catch-up tick and then resumes the schedule rather than replaying a burst
//! of missed slots (the open-question #2 resolution in P7.md).
//!
//! # Concurrency policy at the in-flight limit (e38.19)
//!
//! Before firing, the store's shared [`dispatch_with_admission`] gate counts the
//! autopilot's in-flight runs (`autopilot_run WHERE autopilot_id = ? AND
//! completed_at IS NULL`). That gate is SHARED with every other trigger surface
//! (manual fire-now, the webhook ingress, the `api` trigger) so none can drift
//! from the policy this loop is tested against. When the count has reached
//! `max_concurrent_runs`, the autopilot's
//! [`ConcurrencyPolicy`](ainb_hangar_store::repo::autopilot::ConcurrencyPolicy)
//! decides what happens — and the three policies genuinely
//! change what the scheduler DOES, not just a stored flag:
//!
//! - `skip` (the v1 default): drop the tick. NO `agent_task_queue` row is
//!   created, a `tracing::warn!` is emitted, an [`SchedulerEvent::TickSkipped`]
//!   is published — and, since migration 0057, a TERMINAL `autopilot_run` row
//!   with `status = 'skipped'` and the admission reason is recorded, so a
//!   declined dispatch is visible to every read path instead of existing only
//!   as a log line. It stamps `completed_at`, so it never counts as in flight.
//! - `queue`: fire the tick ANYWAY (create the run + task). The shared
//!   claim/dispatch queue then drains the enqueued tasks in order, so the second
//!   tick RUNS AFTER the in-flight one rather than being dropped.
//! - `replace`: supersede the in-flight run(s) — cancel each open run + its task
//!   ([`supersede_in_flight`](ainb_hangar_store::repo::autopilot_run::supersede_in_flight))
//!   — then fire a fresh run + task. The latest tick
//!   wins; the stale in-flight work is abandoned.
//!
//! In every case `next_tick_at` is still advanced so the autopilot rejoins the
//! schedule at its next slot.
//!
//! # The wake handle — re-evaluating when injected time jumps (the e2e seam)
//!
//! The loop derives its sleep from `(next_tick_at - clock.now_ms())` and then
//! parks in [`tokio::time::sleep`], which counts down against the *real* monotonic
//! clock. That is correct in production (the injected clock is [`SystemClock`], so
//! injected-now and real-now advance together), but it breaks the deterministic
//! e2e: a test that "fast-forwards" a [`HangarClock`] by mutating it while the
//! loop is parked would leave the loop asleep on its old, now-stale deadline — it
//! would not fire until real wall-clock time caught up (minutes later), defeating
//! the whole point of an injected clock.
//!
//! The fix is an optional [`WakeHandle`] (a shared [`Notify`]) added as a third
//! arm of the `select!`:
//!
//! ```text
//! select! {
//!   shutdown.cancelled() => break              // cooperative stop
//!   sleep(delay)         => fire-or-skip        // the tick actually came due
//!   wake.notified()      => continue (re-loop)  // injected time jumped; recompute
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! A clock that can be advanced (the test-only [`AdvanceableClock`]) bumps its
//! epoch-ms *and* triggers the wake in one step. On the wake the loop simply
//! re-iterates: it re-reads the enabled autopilots and recomputes the delay
//! against the now-advanced `clock.now_ms()`. If the advance pushed `now` past the
//! earliest `next_tick_at`, [`sleep_delay`] clamps the new delay to zero and the
//! tick fires immediately and deterministically — no real-time wait, no busy
//! spin. Production wires no wake handle, so the third arm never fires and the
//! loop behaves exactly as before. The handle is the single seam the e2e
//! tripwires (and a future graceful-reschedule signal) drive.
