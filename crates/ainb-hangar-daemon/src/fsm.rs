//! The task-lifecycle state machine (T8 — `statig` typed transitions).
//!
//! The `agent_task_queue` lifecycle
//! (`queued -> dispatched -> running -> done | failed | cancelled`, plus the
//! stale-dispatch reclaim `dispatched -> queued` and the queued-TTL
//! `queued -> failed`) is modelled here as a `statig` compile-time hierarchical
//! state machine. Each legal edge of
//! [`TaskState::legal_transitions`](ainb_hangar_core::task::state::TaskState::legal_transitions)
//! is realised by exactly one [`LifecycleEvent`]; every other `(state, event)`
//! pair is rejected (no transition).
//!
//! # What this types, and what it does NOT
//!
//! This types the **in-process transition ordering** the daemon's claim loop
//! walks ([`crate::run_loop::execute_claimed`] drives `dispatched -> running`
//! then a terminal `done` / `failed`): before issuing each store-service DB
//! write, the loop advances a [`LifecycleGuard`] through the corresponding
//! typed edge, so an out-of-order finalize (e.g. `complete` before `start`)
//! surfaces as a typed [`IllegalLifecycleTransition`] rather than a silent
//! mis-step.
//!
//! It does **not** replace the DB-level enforcers. The per-(issue, agent) SQL
//! claim guard (`idx_one_pending_task_per_issue_agent`, migration 0012) and the
//! idempotent conditional-`UPDATE` finalize in
//! [`ainb_hangar_store::service`] remain authoritative for atomicity and races
//! across daemons. The `statig` machine types the single daemon's own ordered
//! call sequence; the SQL layer arbitrates concurrency.
//!
//! The [`tests`] module sweeps the full `(state × event)` product and asserts
//! the machine realises **exactly** the canonical edge set from
//! `TaskState::legal_transitions()`, so the typed FSM can never drift from the
//! one source of truth in `ainb-hangar-core`.
