//! The daemon's one shutdown seam: what asked it to stop, and how much to tear
//! down on the way out.
//!
//! The daemon used to handle `ctrl_c()` (SIGINT) alone, while the supported stop
//! command (`ainb hangar daemon stop`) sends SIGTERM. With no handler for it the
//! process died on the OS default disposition, so NONE of the teardown below ran:
//! headless provider children were reparented to init and kept mutating their
//! workspaces unsupervised, and the ownership lock was never released. Every
//! sibling daemon in this workspace (`mcp_pool`, `notifyd`) already handled
//! SIGTERM; the hangar daemon was the outlier.
//!
//! # Why the two causes differ
//!
//! [`Cause::Interrupt`] is a human in the foreground saying "tear it all down",
//! and takes in-flight interactive tmux sessions with it.
//!
//! [`Cause::Terminate`] is `daemon stop` / `daemon restart` — which runs after
//! every upgrade. Killing the operator's attached agent panes on an upgrade would
//! destroy work the daemon merely supervises, so interactive sessions are left
//! running; the boot tmux reconciler re-adopts them with exact pane identity.
//! Headless children are still killed in both cases (they are unattended, and
//! leaving them reparented to init is the leak this seam exists to stop).
