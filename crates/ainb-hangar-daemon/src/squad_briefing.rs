//! Claim-time squad-leader briefing (multica `squad_briefing.go` parity, gap #7).
//!
//! When the daemon claims a task carrying a `squad_id` AND the claiming agent is
//! that squad's LEADER, it appends this briefing to the run's materialised
//! `CLAUDE.md` so the leader agent runs with squad context (the coordinator role
//! + the roster of members it can delegate to). Member tasks and non-squad tasks
//! get no briefing.
//!
//! # Faithful where it matters, honest where hangar differs
//!
//! Ported from multica's `buildSquadLeaderBriefing`, with two deliberate
//! divergences the current hangar schema forces:
//!
//! - **No @mention dispatch.** Multica's roster carries literal
//!   `[@Name](mention://<type>/<uuid>)` strings that round-trip through its
//!   mention-parse pipeline. Hangar has no such trigger, so the protocol
//!   describes coordination without promising a mention link it cannot honour,
//!   and roster rows carry `name — <agent|human> — <id>` (no mention markdown).
//! - **Roster SKILLS mean what hangar will actually MATERIALISE for that
//!   member, not every attached link.** Multica's `agentSkillsRosterSegment`
//!   reads one live tool registry; hangar has dispatch-time materialisation
//!   governed by TWO levers, and the roster applies BOTH — `agent_skill.enabled`
//!   (migration 0051) and the by-name `agent.disabled_runtime_skills` list — so
//!   the leader never routes work to a capability the member will not have on
//!   disk. Faithful to multica's intent (advertise real capability) even though
//!   multica has only one lever.
//!
//! Per-member `role`, per-member `skills` and `squad.instructions` ARE rendered:
//! a roled member's row carries a `— role: <label>` suffix, a skilled AGENT
//! member's row carries a trailing `— skills: <a>, <b>`, and a non-blank
//! `squad.instructions` becomes the third section `## Squad Instructions`,
//! appended VERBATIM. Each fragment is independently blank-omitted — exactly as
//! multica omits its own when the underlying value is empty:
//!
//! ```text
//! - <name> — agent — <id>[ — role: <role>][ — skills: <a>, <b>]
//! - <email|id> — human — <id>[ — role: <role>]
//! ```

const SQUAD_OPERATING_PROTOCOL: &str = "\
## Squad Operating Protocol

**You have been activated as a squad LEADER for this task.** Your job is to \
**coordinate** the squad, not to silently do all the work yourself. Even if the \
task reads like a direct request to \"do X\", prefer to delegate X to the squad \
member best suited to it — doing everything yourself defeats the purpose of the \
squad.

Your responsibilities, in order:

1. **Read the issue** (title, description, latest comments, acceptance criteria) \
and decide which squad member is best suited to do the work. Pick from the \
members listed in the Squad Roster below, matching the task to each member's \
stated role and skills.
2. **Delegate and sequence the work** across the members in the Squad Roster. \
Split the work so each member owns the part that fits them.
3. **Coordinate, don't re-do.** Track what each member is doing and how the \
pieces fit together; only do the work yourself when no member is suitable.
4. **Stop after coordinating.** Once you have decided the plan and handed work \
to the members, end your turn — you will be re-triggered when a member reports \
back or the issue moves forward.
5. **Re-evaluate on each trigger.** When you wake again, read the new activity \
and decide the next step: delegate the next piece, escalate to the reporter, or \
close the loop.

Hard rules:
- Only involve members that appear in the Squad Roster below — nobody else is \
part of this squad.
- Do NOT restate the issue body or prior discussion when you delegate — every \
member already has the full issue context.
- Do NOT do the implementation work yourself unless the squad has no suitable \
member for it.
