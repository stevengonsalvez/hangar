//! Hourly payload-eviction sweep over the `fleet_provider_event` source ledger.
//!
//! One stage, not three. `fleet_event`'s sweeper
//! ([`crate::fleet_retention`]) also deletes rows and carries a byte ceiling;
//! this one only blanks `raw_payload`, because the row itself is the thing this
//! table exists to keep. `ingest_order`, `event_id`, `raw_blake3` and
//! `projection_revision` all survive every sweep.
//!
//! ## Why this exists at all
//!
//! `fleet_provider_event` had NO automatic retention from 0071 to 0094, on the
//! documented assumption that projection-source rows grow ~1.3 MB per YEAR.
//! Measured on a real profile: **372,031 rows / 2,207 MB**, a ~5.9 KB mean
//! payload. At that size the table saturated the single `SQLite` writer and
//! session spawn started failing with `database is locked`. The store module's
//! header records the reversed decision; this is the mechanism.
//!
//! ## What it never touches
//!
//! Both refusals live in the SQL, not here, so no caller can opt out of them
//! (see `FleetProviderEventRepo::evict_projected_payloads_before`):
//!
//! * `projection_revision IS NULL` — unreduced events, including the pending
//!   recovery work the Codex manager replays at startup. Their payload IS the
//!   replay input.
//! * `source = 'acp'` — ACP transcripts reclaim through the operator's
//!   export-then-delete, which exports before it destroys.
//!
//! ## No tombstone, and no watermark either
//!
//! `fleet_event` needs `payload_evicted_at` because its `'{}'` sentinel cannot
//! be told apart from an event that carried no body, and because an unstamped
//! row would be re-selected by every later batch. Here the sentinel is `''`,
//! which no provider envelope can be, so `raw_payload <> ''` is self-converging:
//! an evicted row leaves the sweep's partial index the moment it is written.
//! That doubles as the resume point — a daemon killed mid-backlog restarts on
//! exactly the rows it had not reached, with no in-memory cursor and no column
//! to persist. `a_backlog_stops_on_its_budget_and_resumes_across_a_restart`
//! proves that across a real pool close and reopen.
//!
//! ## The database FILE does not shrink, and must not be made to
//!
//! Eviction returns pages to `SQLite`'s freelist, where later writes reuse
//! them; it does not return them to the filesystem. Measured on a copy of a
//! real 2.1 GB profile: this sweep reclaimed 1,159.8 MB of payload (1,506.0 MB
//! live payload down to 346.2 MB) and the file stayed 2.1 GB with 258,001 free
//! pages inside it. That is the intended outcome — the table stops GROWING —
//! and an operator watching `ls -lh hangar.db` should not read it as a failure.
//! `VACUUM` would rewrite the whole file under an exclusive lock, which is
//! precisely the writer stall this module exists to prevent.
//!
//! Scheduling discipline is inherited wholesale from [`crate::fleet_retention`]
//! and is load-bearing for the same reason: ONE writer, shared with the Fleet
//! reconciler and the ACP transcript writer. Own task, bounded batches, a yield
//! and a WAL checkpoint between them, and the sleep taken AFTER the work.
