/// but never beat it.
///
/// A shorter floor was tried first (5 min) and measured: it fixed the frequency

/// scan no longer materialises a `Vec<ProviderCall>` for the whole corpus, it
/// folds each file into the three windows and drops it
/// (`scanner::scan_windows`), which measured 1,747 MB down to ~720 MB.
///
/// The floor still earns its keep even at that price. A ~12 s scan four times an
