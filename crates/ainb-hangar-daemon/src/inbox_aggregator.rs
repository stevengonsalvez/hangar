//! The daemon's inbox aggregator — the writer that turns the live event stream
//! into the durable inbox (e38.14).
//!
//! [`crate::events::EventBroker`] has fanned typed [`HangarEvent`]s from the
//! daemon's mutation paths to subscribed plugins since e38.2, but those events
//! were *purely live*: a plugin that was not attached when an event fired never
//! saw it, and there was no unread count or mark-read. This module closes that
//! gap. It subscribes to the broker exactly like an RPC connection does, maps
//! each issue / comment / task [`HangarEvent`] to one [`NewInboxEntry`], and
//! writes it to the `inbox_entry` table (migration 0021) so the inbox screen and
//! the `hangar/inbox_list` RPC read a durable aggregate.
//!
//! ## Take-effect seam
//!
//! [`spawn`] wires this into the live daemon: `boot()` spawns it alongside the
//! RPC server and the sweepers, handing it a fresh [`broker.subscribe()`] receiver
//! and the shared pool. From then on every committed mutation that emits an
//! issue/comment/task event ALSO lands an inbox row — the aggregation is not a
//! schema waiting for a writer, it is the writer.
//!
//! ## Which events aggregate
//!
//! Only the three families the inbox is *about* produce a row: issue lifecycle
//! (`IssueCreated` / `IssueUpdated` / `IssueDeleted`), comments (`CommentAdded`),
//! and task lifecycle (`TaskQueued` / `TaskStarted` / `TaskFinished`). The
//! high-frequency, low-signal events — `TaskProgress` heartbeats, per-line
//! `TaskMessage`, `AgentPresence`, autopilot/workspace/skill housekeeping — are
//! deliberately NOT aggregated: an inbox is a digest, not a transcript firehose.
//! [`entry_for_event`] returns `None` for those, so they pass through silently.
//!
//! ## Delivery semantics
//!
//! Best-effort, mirroring the broker: a write fault is logged and dropped, never
//! propagated (a failed inbox write must never down the daemon or lose the live
//! event the plugin already received). A lagged receiver (a slow aggregator that
//! fell behind the broadcast capacity) skips the dropped events and keeps going —
//! the next snapshot pull reconciles.
