//! The daemon's answer router — deliver an answer to one open attention row from
//! any surface, exactly once, into the right session (architecture §4.3, spec P2).
//!
//! Every surface (TUI control centre, web, bridge, ATC) answers through the same
//! `attention/answer` RPC, which lands here. The router enforces the two
//! guarantees the converged inbox promises:
//!
//! 1. **First-answer-wins (exactly-once):** the `open → answered` flip is a
//!    conditional UPDATE ([`AttentionRepo::mark_answered_if_open`]). Two surfaces
//!    answering the same row serialise at the database; exactly one flips it and
//!    delivers, the other is told "already answered by X" and delivers nothing.
//!
//! 2. **C1 misroute refusal:** an answer must reach the EXACT agent that asked.
//!    The hook's session id often differs from a discovered [`Session::id`], so an
//!    exact-id miss falls back to a cwd correlation — but two agents can share a
//!    cwd, so an ambiguous cwd would risk sending the answer to the WRONG agent.
//!    The router REFUSES on ambiguity (more than one discovered session in the
//!    cwd, or a merged session that aggregated 2+ sources) rather than guess —
//!    the guard lifted from the TUI fleet panel's `control::resolve_and_send`.
//!    Attention rows are also DURABLE and outlive the raising agent, so the
//!    router additionally binds the cwd fallback to the transcript captured at
//!    raise time: if the original session has exited and a DIFFERENT agent now
//!    occupies the cwd (its transcript is newer), the router refuses rather than
//!    answer an agent that never asked.
//!
//! Ordering matters: the C1 target resolution runs BEFORE the flip, so an
//! ambiguous or dead target leaves the row OPEN and answerable later (a session
//! may exit, or the ambiguity may resolve). Only once a unique target is known
//! does the router claim the row (win-or-lose) and deliver via the one verified
//! send path ([`send`], the multi-line-submit-verified tmux path).
//!
//! An ACP `session/request_permission` row is the one exception to the pane
//! path: it carries its own pool session key and the adapter's option set, so
//! it is answered through [`crate::acp_pool::AcpPool::answer_permission`]
//! (`answer_acp`) with the same first-answer-wins claim and no tmux at all.
