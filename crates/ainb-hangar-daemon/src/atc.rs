//! ATC on the daemon (D12, spec P9 §4.7) — instance registry, the heartbeat
//! cron, and escalation → attention.
//!
//! P9 pulls ATC off its launchd/systemd side-timers and JSON side-files onto the
//! daemon:
//!
//! - **Registry + heartbeat cron.** `ainb fleet atc setup` registers an instance
//!   in `atc_instance` (via RPC) and the heartbeat becomes a daemon cron job —
//!   the [`AtcHeartbeatScheduler`] reuses the autopilot scheduler's DB-durable
//!   tick loop (earliest `next_tick_at` → sleep → fire → reschedule), so restart
//!   survival lives in the DB, not a launchd plist.
//! - **Retry cap in the store.** The per-session auto-`continue` cap is enforced
//!   against the durable `atc_retry` ledger ([`err_action`]), not an advisory
//!   JSON the model might stop maintaining. `task-log.md` stays as human audit.
//! - **Escalations become attention rows.** An exhausted / stuck session is
//!   raised through the SAME attention pipeline every other input request uses
//!   ([`raise_escalation`], kind=escalation) so it reaches the phone/web push
//!   instead of dead-ending in `task-log.md`.
