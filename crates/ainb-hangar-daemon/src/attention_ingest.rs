//! The attention ingest producer (spec P2, D10) — the daemon's own tail of the
//! durable hook event log (`events.jsonl`) into the `attention` table.
//!
//! The lifecycle hook (`ainb fleet atc hook`) appends one JSON line per Claude
//! event to `~/.agents-in-a-box/events.jsonl`. notifyd already ingests that file
//! into ITS sqlite for OS notifications; this is the SECOND, independent consumer
//! the converged control centre needs — the one that folds every input-request
//! into the answerable attention inbox. It owns its OWN byte-offset cursor and
//! reads the shared file directly, rather than cross-reading notifyd's rusqlite,
//! so the T2 store boundary holds (the daemon is sqlx-only; it never touches
//! another crate's DB).
//!
//! ## Pipeline
//!
//! For each qualifying hook line (`Notification` / `Stop` / `SubagentStop` — the
//! events that can mean "this session needs a human"), the producer runs the
//! SAME needs classifier the fleet panel uses ([`classify`], ASK > ERR > IDLE >
//! WAIT), and — when it fires — inserts a durable `attention` row and emits an
//! `AttentionRaised` nudge on the fleet-wide stream.
//!
//! The one exception is a Claude AskUserQuestion, which is read from the hook
//! payload instead ([`ask_context_from_hook_payload`]): Claude withholds the
//! picker's `tool_use` row from the transcript until the tool RESOLVES, so a
//! transcript read while the question is open finds nothing and no interview
//! could ever raise a card.
//!
//! ## Idempotency
//!
//! The attention id uses the hook's durable event ID:
//! `att:<session>:<event_id>`. Legacy lines fall back to their absolute byte
//! offset. The event ID is stable across replay, so:
//!
//!   - A re-read of the SAME line (a crash between insert and the cursor write, a
//!     best-effort cursor-write failure, or a corrupt/missing cursor that resets
//!     the read to 0) has the SAME id → the insert is skipped → no
//!     duplicate card. Re-reading from 0 raises each request exactly once, so the
//!     cursor is a pure efficiency optimisation, not a correctness dependency.
//!   - A genuinely NEW occurrence (a fresh hook line — the same question asked
//!     again after the first was answered, or a recurring error) is appended at a
//!     NEW offset → a NEW id → a fresh row, even when its request context is
//!     byte-for-byte identical to a prior one.
//!
//! Event IDs avoid context hashes, whose time-derived fields can change when a
//! line is re-classified. Legacy offsets remain invariant to read time.
//!
//! The event ID alone is NOT enough for an ASK, because Claude re-fires
//! `Notification` while a session stays blocked and each firing is a genuinely
//! new event: one live question was measured raising three cards. ASK rows
//! therefore also carry a `request_key` ([`request_key_of`], migration 0081):
//! every firing that observes the SAME still-open question derives the same key
//! and collapses onto the first row. Once that row is closed the key is free
//! again, so a repeat of the same question is still raisable.
//!
//! ## Convergence
//!
//! [`AttentionIngest::sweep_once`] closes open rows no live Fleet session
//! claims. The `attention` table and `fleet_session.attention_state` are two
//! independent records of "needs input" with no cross-writes; without a
//! reconcile they drift apart indefinitely (732 open rows against 7 waiting
//! sessions, measured live).
//!
//! ## Delivery semantics
//!
//! Best-effort: a missing file is a no-op and a corrupt line is skipped. A store
//! fault leaves the cursor before the failed line so a later pass replays it.
//! A failed ingest never downs the daemon.
