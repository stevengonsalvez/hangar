//! One-time boot import of `~/.agents-in-a-box/sessions.json` into the
//! daemon-owned `sessions` table (spec P6d, #1166).
//!
//! ```text
//! boot ──▶ marker for this path? ──yes──▶ AlreadyCompleted (nothing read)
//!                │ no
//!                ▼
//!          file missing ──▶ marker, 0 rows (fresh home)
//!          over cap / unreadable / unparseable ──▶ Err, NO marker
//!          parsed ──▶ validate each record ──▶ rows + marker, one tx
//! ```
//!
//! The file is only ever read, never written, so a user who downgrades keeps
//! every session it held. The marker (migration 0102) is what makes the import
//! one-time: a row deleted after the import is not brought back by the next
//! boot. Until a marker exists, `workspace/session_list` answers
//! `import_complete: false` and the CLI keeps reading the file, so a failed
//! import can never make a populated file look empty.
//!
//! # Repeatable reconcile (P6e)
//!
//! While P6d was dark every surface wrote the file only, so the file holds
//! sessions the table lacks. [`reconcile_sessions`] closes that gap and keeps
//! closing it: it runs at boot after the import, on a client's
//! `workspace/session_reconcile`, and whenever the file's mtime moves
//! ([`ReconcileWatch`], every [`RECONCILE_INTERVAL`]).
//!
//! ```text
//! pass ──▶ flock sessions.json (bounded) ──▶ read + parse
//!            │ timeout / read / parse error ──▶ Err, marker unchanged
//!            ▼
//!          one tx: delete every table row the file does not have,
//!          insert every file session the table lacks,
//!          skip + count a tmux name still bound to another id,
//!          write the <path>#reconcile marker ──▶ release the flock
//! ```
//!
//! The pass holds the flock from before its read until its commit, so no
//! flock-taking writer can add or remove a file row in between. Until the
//! flip the file is the authority on which sessions exist and the table on
//! their contents: a pass deletes a table row the file lacks and never
//! overwrites a row both have. That is sound because every pre-flip writer
//! writes the file row before the table row (the daemon's own registration
//! included, which writes no table row when its file write fails). The table is
//! authoritative for a client only once the import AND a pass have finished
//! (`SessionsRepo::import_complete_for`).
