//! Daemon observability bootstrap (P8.1).
//!
//! [`install`] is the single place the daemon wires up `tracing`.
//!
//! It composes a [`tracing_subscriber::Registry`] with three layers:
//!
//! - an [`EnvFilter`] driven by `RUST_LOG` (falling back to `info`), so an
//!   operator can flip to `RUST_LOG=debug` live without a recompile;
//! - a JSON [`fmt`](tracing_subscriber::fmt) layer writing to a **non-blocking,
//!   daily-rotated** appender at `<log_dir>/daemon.<date>` — this is the
//!   `daemon.jsonl`-shaped sink the P8.6 CLI/TUI logs-tail surfaces read back;
//! - a human-readable stderr `fmt` layer for the dev TTY.
//!
//! It returns the [`WorkerGuard`] from `tracing_appender::non_blocking`. **The
//! caller MUST keep this guard alive for the whole process lifetime** — dropping
//! it flushes and shuts down the background writer thread, silently losing any
//! buffered log lines (the classic non-blocking-appender footgun). `main` binds
//! it to a `_guard` local that lives until the daemon exits.
//!
//! The subscriber is installed exactly once via [`tracing_subscriber::registry`]
//! + `.init()`. A second call would panic on the global-default already being
//! set, so `install` must be called once from `main` before any service spans
//! are emitted.
