//! Durable issue-comment emission at run-loop lifecycle checkpoints (e38.6).
//!
//! A running agent streams its work to the live transcript (the runner tees the
//! provider's JSONL to `logs/<provider>.jsonl`), but that buffer is bounded and
//! rolls — once it overflows, the record of *what the agent did* is gone. The
//! issue's `comment` thread (e38.5) is the durable surface: a row in the
//! `comment` table outlives any transcript window.
//!
//! This module bridges the two. At each FSM checkpoint the run loop reaches —
//! the task starts running, and the run finishes (success / failure / timeout) —
//! it calls [`emit_checkpoint`], which writes one **agent-authored** comment to
//! the task's issue so the activity is recorded permanently in the thread the
//! UI already renders.
//!
//! # Authorship
//!
//! The comment is authored as the **running agent** (`agent:<agent_id>`), so it
//! shows in the issue's comment thread attributed to the actor that did the
//! work — exactly where a user looking at the issue expects to see it.
//!
//! # Scoping
//!
//! Only a task bound to an issue (`issue_id = Some`) gets comments — a chat /
//! autopilot placeholder task carries a `NULL` issue (see
//! [`Task::issue_id`](ainb_hangar_store::repo::task::Task::issue_id)) and is
//! skipped silently. The write is workspace-scoped through [`CommentRepo`]'s
//! join to `issue`, so a comment can only land on an issue in the task's own
//! tenant.
//!
//! # Best-effort
//!
//! A comment is *observability*, never part of the task FSM. Every fault here
//! (the issue vanished, a store error, a malformed agent id) is logged and
//! swallowed — [`emit_checkpoint`] returns `()` and never propagates, so a
//! comment-write fault can never block or fail the task transition that
//! triggered it. The FSM write has already committed by the time we comment.
