//! The daemon-owned ACP agent pool: MULTIPLEXED, one adapter process per

//! ```
//!
//! Five properties are load-bearing and each has a test:
//!
//! * **Demux is exact.** Every `session/update` is routed by its own
//!   `sessionId`; a chunk whose id no session claims is logged and DROPPED, never
//!   attributed to a neighbour. On a shared process, cross-attribution would put
//!   one tenant's output in another tenant's transcript.
//! * **At most once (I6).** A prompt is requeued ONLY when it provably never
//!   reached the adapter, which here means the failure happened before
//!   `session/prompt` was issued at all (spawn refused, session/new failed, or
//!   the transport was already closed at [`AdapterProcess::is_alive`]). After the
//!   request is issued the outcome is turn end or UNKNOWN, never a blind resend.
//! * **Convergence is not boot-only (I16).** An adapter that exits, or a turn
//!   that outlives its deadline, runs [`converge_dirty_session`] — the SAME
//!   function the boot scan runs. Under the multiplex it fans out to every
//!   session the dead process hosted. Convergence can only reach turns the
//!   STORE knows about, so a turn whose `open_turn_id` will not persist is
//!   never issued ([`DELIVERY_TURN_UNRECORDED`]).
//! * **A turn ends in ONE transaction.** The receipt, the agent's reply and the
//!   released session commit together, and the receipt gates the reply
//!   ([`FleetAcpSessionRepo::commit_turn_end`]), so no crash publishes an
//!   answer the receipt says never landed. The transcript's completion marker
//!   is committed first, on purpose: the only crash window it leaves is a turn
//!   the boot scan still lists as dirty.
//! * **Work is bounded; notifications are not.** The per-scope prompt queue is
//!   a bounded channel (a full queue is a REJECTED delivery carrying
//!   [`DELIVERY_QUEUE_FULL`], never silent growth), the per-process in-flight
//!   count is a semaphore, and the session count per provider is capped with LRU
//!   idle eviction. The ONE deliberate exception is the `session/update` and
//!   `session/request_permission` demux channels, which are unbounded: dropping
//!   a transcript notification is data loss and blocking the shared connection
//!   task would stall every OTHER tenant on the same process. The ceiling there
//!   is therefore observability, not backpressure: `transcript_bytes` on
//!   `hangar/daemon_health` reports what each session has committed so a chatty
//!   adapter against a contended writer is visible before it is a memory
//!   incident.
//! * **A queued prompt always has an outcome.** Convergence DRAINS the queue and
//!   resolves every drained job terminal (I16), and `start_turn` re-reads the
//!   leg before issuing, so a prompt whose delivery is already terminal is never
//!   sent.
//! * **A blocked permission is answerable.** `session/request_permission` parks
//!   its responder here and raises an attention row; the answer arrives through
//!   `fleet/action` and reaches the adapter's pending JSON-RPC id. A permission
//!   whose adapter dies is retired the moment its turn ends, and by convergence
//!   when no turn was open to end, never left as a ghost row for an operator to
//!   click at a delivery they can already see resolved.
//!   EVERY parked ask is answerable, not just the newest: an adapter running
//!   parallel tool calls blocks on several at once, and `parked` (not
//!   `fleet_session.current_request_fingerprint`, which has room for one) is
//!   what says which are live.
//!
//! # A TASK session also streams live (track A step A5's live half)
//!
//! A session whose scope is `task:<id>` publishes every transcript row it
//! commits as a `HangarEvent::TaskMessage` as well, through the same
//! [`crate::runner::RunStream`] the process executor publishes with and the same
//! [`AcpClassifier`] the durable `board_card_timeline` read classifies with. A
//! chat session publishes nothing: it has no task to name, and its transcript
//! has its own stream. [`bind_task_stream`] is the whole discriminator.
//!
//! **Live is published BEFORE the durable commit, and that is a real
//! asymmetry, not a detail.** The writer buffers and commits on a cadence, so
//! publishing after it would hold the operator's view back by up to a flush
//! interval. The cost is that [`StoreWriter`] may later DROP a buffered row
//! under memory pressure (minting an `acp.transcript_truncated` marker in its
//! place), and that row was already streamed: in that window the live view
//! carries a line the durable re-read does not. The process executor has no
//! equivalent, because its tee to disk is unconditional and happens first. So
//! "live equals durable" holds for any run whose transcript buffer does not
//! overflow, which is the same shape as the qualification the 512 KiB tail
//! already puts on the other end of that equality.
