//! Retention sweep over the `mutation_ledger` (spec D18).
//!
//! The ledger stores a serialized reply per mutation, so it grows with every
//! write the daemon serves and bounds nothing on its own. D18 fixes the bound
//! at 7 days or 100k rows, whichever comes first, and
//! [`MutationLedgerRepo::retain`] implements it, but a retention policy with
//! no caller is a comment. The sibling tables are the evidence: `fleet_event`
//! reached 1.1M rows and 847 MB under no retention at all.
//!
//! Two stages, and the order is the whole point (see the migration's own note):
//!
//! ```text
//!   expire  7 d / 100k live rows ──▶ drop the reply, KEEP the key
//!   delete  14 d / 100k tombstones ──▶ remove the key
//! ```
//!
//! Stage one drops all the bulk while leaving a ~60-byte tombstone, so a retry
//! that arrives late is answered `unknown{op_expired}` instead of executed a
//! second time. A single hard delete would bound the storage and silently
//! reintroduce the double-execution this whole phase exists to stop.
//!
//! Scheduling follows `fleet_retention`'s shape for the same reason it does:
//! `SQLite` has one writer, shared with the Fleet reconciler and the transcript
//! writer, so this runs on its own task with the sleep taken AFTER the work,
//! never on a ticker that could stack passes.
