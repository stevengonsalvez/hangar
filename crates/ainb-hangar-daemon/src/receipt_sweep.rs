//! Boot resolution for mutation receipts a dead daemon left mid-flight
//! (spec D18, critique amendment 17).
//!
//! A receipt in `writing` is the one state the daemon cannot reason its way out
//! of after a crash: `writing` is committed immediately before the first byte
//! reaches the PTY, so the bytes may have landed or may not. Both of the tidy
//! answers are wrong:
//!
//! ```text
//!   reopen the row   ──▶ a retry types the answer a SECOND time
//!   close it quietly ──▶ a blocked agent waits forever and nobody is told
//! ```
//!
//! So the row becomes `unknown{effects_ambiguous}` and surfaces as a
//! `delivery_unconfirmed` attention row naming the answer text. Only an
//! operator closes it.
//!
//! A receipt still in `claimed` is a different fact and gets a different
//! answer: `writing` was never committed, so no byte can have reached the PTY.
//! The attention row was flipped by a claim whose delivery never happened, and
//! reopening it is exactly the compensation
//! [`crate::answer`] already performs for a failed send.
