//! The board auto-move dispatch hook (P4 / D8).
//!
//! When a claimed task walks its FSM (`dispatched → running → done | failed`),
//! the claim loop calls [`auto_move_after_transition`] with the new status. For
//! the task's issue, every board carrying it as a card moves the card to the
//! column whose `fsm_state` matches — but only when both the board's master
//! `auto_move` toggle and the target column's `auto_move` flag are on
//! ([`BoardRepo::auto_move_on_state`]). This is the D8 "column↔FSM-state mapping +
//! per-board auto-move toggle" made real: a card slides to `Done` (green) the
//! moment its work succeeds, without the user dragging anything.
//!
//! The TUI reflects the move on its next `hangar/boards_list` pull (which it
//! triggers off the already-emitted `TaskStarted` / `TaskFinished` events), so no
//! new event type is needed here — the hook's whole job is the durable card move.
//!
//! # Best-effort
//!
//! Every fault (a chat task with no issue, a malformed workspace id, a store
//! error) is logged and swallowed: the task's terminal FSM state has already
//! committed, and an auto-move failure must never down the claim loop. A task
//! with no matching auto-move column is a silent no-op.
