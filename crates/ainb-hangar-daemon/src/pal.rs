//!
//! Four properties are load-bearing here:
//!
//! * **The park is BOUNDED.** A card nobody answers expires at
//!   [`confirm_ttl`], which is deliberately far shorter than part 1's
//!   30-minute per-turn deadline. A suspended tool result holds Pal's
//!   ACP turn open, and that turn holds its scope's FIFO queue, so an unbounded
//!   park would wedge the channel behind one unanswered dialog. The expiry
//!   resolves the tool as DENIED, which is the fail-closed direction.
//! * **The card carries PROJECTED arguments.** [`ainb_fleet_tools::server::project_arguments`]
//!   runs before the row is persisted, so a model-authored `justification` or
//!   `operator_approved` key never reaches the human's approve dialog. The
//!   classifier already ignores undeclared keys; this is the same fence for the
//!   human verdict. An `edit` answer is projected AND re-classified, because the
//!   operator's replacement arguments have never been past the classifier.
//! * **A card is single-use.** The store resolves under `WHERE state = 'open'`,
//!   so an answer racing the expiry has exactly one winner and the loser gets a
//!   typed error rather than a second execution.
//! * **Every Pal action lands an activity row.** Including the refusals and
//!   the expiries, because "zero unlogged Pal writes" is only checkable if
//!   the log covers the calls that did NOT happen too.

/// inherited by the tool server, and visible to anything either of them spawns.
/// `ainb_fleet_tools::keyfile` refuses to start if a token ever does arrive in
/// its environment or its argv.
///
/// And it is not the DAEMON's token file either. The credential minted here is
/// scoped to this Pal channel and, per
/// [`Caller`](crate::rpc::auth::Caller), reaches only the read methods, the
/// gate, and the two writes the tool table can perform after the gate said run.
/// It cannot answer its own confirm cards and it cannot write a chat row wearing
/// the operator's name. The keyfile ceremony stops the credential leaking into
/// an unrelated child's environment; the SCOPE is what limits the agent the
/// injection is steering.
///
/// What this still does not survive: a Pal adapter configured with shell or
/// file tools of its own. Such an agent can read `~/.agents-in-a-box` as the
/// operator, and the daemon token there is the operator's credential. The
/// guardrail assumes Pal's only reach into the fleet is this tool table.
///
/// Degrades to NO tools rather than to ungated ones: if the binary or the
/// keyfile cannot be resolved, Pal is a chat partner with no fleet
/// access at all, which is the fail-closed direction.
