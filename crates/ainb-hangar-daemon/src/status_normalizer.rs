// ABOUTME: Per-provider status event normalizers and the unknown-name counters
// that make an unrecognised provider event visible instead of silent (D14).
//
// Every provider spells the same five or six facts differently. Codex says
// `agent-turn-complete`, Claude says `Stop`, an OSC frame says `turn_complete`.
// The reducer speaks ONE vocabulary (Claude's, because it was first and the
// tables already hold its tokens), so every other spelling is translated here,
// in one place, rather than in a match arm inside whatever consumer noticed the
// difference first.
//
// # Order
//
// The spec fixes the order the normalizers are tried, and it is not arbitrary:
//
// 1. the Claude-compatible family, which is every provider whose hooks emit
//    Claude's own event names or a near-alias of them,
// 2. the published OSC in-band frame schema, which carries its own explicit
//    event names and therefore needs no guessing,
// 3. the session-state family, the generic `state: running|waiting|done`
//    spellings a provider emits when it has no lifecycle hooks at all.
//
// A provider is tried in that order because each step is strictly less certain
// than the one before it. Reversing it would let a generic `waiting` outrank a
// provider's own explicit `request_user_input`.
//
// # Unknown names are counted, never an error
//
// A normalizer answers `None` for a name it does not know. It never errors, and
// the caller never drops the event: the row still gets its clocks, its pane
// binding and its provenance, it simply gains no lifecycle transition. That is
// the correct behaviour for a provider that ships a new event name in a point
// release: the alternative is a daemon that refuses lines it could have stored.
//
// Silence, though, is how an unmapped name stays unmapped for a year. Every
// `None` increments `status_unknown_event{provider,name}`, which `fleet/status`
// returns and `ainb doctor` prints, so "Codex 0.160 added
// `agent-turn-aborted`" shows up as a number an operator can see rather than as
// sessions that mysteriously stop advancing.
