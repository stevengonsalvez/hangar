//! Interactive-mode provider launch: a REAL, attachable tmux session per task
//! (ccc / D6).
//!
//! A board card launched with `mode = interactive` (the D6 `Run ▾` menu) does
//! NOT go through the headless [`Runner::run_claude`](crate::runner::Runner)
//! pipe-and- capture path. Instead the daemon spawns the provider inside a
//! detached tmux session — exactly the shape `ainb run` uses ([`ainb-core`'s
//! `TmuxSession`], `tmux new-session -d -s <name> -c <workdir> …`) — so the
//! agent is a live, attachable terminal that shows up in `tmux ls` like any
//! other session. The session name is `tmux_hangar-<task_id>` (the task id is a
//! ULID, so it is exact and collision-safe), recorded on the task row the
//! moment the session is created ([`crate::run_loop`]) so the attach-from-card
//! affordance can surface a copyable `tmux attach -t <name>` mid-run.
//!
//! # Completion detection
//!
//! The pane runs a generated wrapper that execs the provider under `env -i`
//! (deny-by-default env, identical to the headless allowlist via
//! [`crate::runner::compose_child_env`]) and writes the provider's exit code to
//! a sibling file before the pane closes. [`TmuxRun::wait`] polls
//! [`tmux_session_exists`] until the session is reaped, then maps the recorded
//! exit code onto the same [`RunOutcome`] the headless runner returns — so the
//! daemon's finalize seam (`running -> done | failed`) is byte-identical for
//! both modes. A blown deadline kills the session by its exact name and returns
//! [`FailureReason::Timeout`].
//!
//! [ainb-core's `TmuxSession`]: the host's `crates/ainb-core/src/tmux/session.rs`.
