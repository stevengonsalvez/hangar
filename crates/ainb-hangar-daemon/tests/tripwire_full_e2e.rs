//! P9.3 meta-tripwire — guards the Hangar tripwire suite against silent
//! deletion / rename.
//!
//! Every other `tripwire_*` test proves one user-visible behaviour. This one
//! proves the *suite itself* has not shrunk: it discovers every Hangar
//! `tripwire_*.rs` integration-test binary across the three workspace
//! locations and asserts the discovered count is at least a baseline captured
//! on first run.
//!
//! ```text
//!  crates/ainb-hangar-daemon/tests/tripwire_*.rs   (P4/P7/P8/P9 daemon set)
//!  crates/ainb-hangar-store/tests/tripwire_*.rs    (P0 migration determinism)
//!  crates/ainb-plugin-hangar/tests/tripwire_*.rs          (P3.8/P4.10 plugin roundtrip)
//!         │
//!         ▼  walk dirs, count tripwire_*.rs (skip *_common.rs helpers)
//!  assert discovered >= BASELINE
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why walk files, not parse `cargo test --list`
//!
//! Each `tripwire_*.rs` under a `tests/` dir is its own cargo test *binary*.
//! Walking the directories is hermetic (no recompile, no cargo subprocess, no
//! feature-flag juggling for the `#![cfg(feature = "otlp")]` member) and maps
//! 1:1 onto the thing we want to defend: the set of tripwire binaries
//! `scripts/hangar/run_all_tripwires.sh` runs. Adding a tripwire only ever
//! raises the count; deleting or renaming one drops it below baseline and reds
//! this test, forcing an intentional baseline bump.
//!
//! ## Baseline
//!
//! `BASELINE_TRIPWIRES` was captured by running the discovery once and reading
//! the actual count (25 on the P9.3 commit; 28 once the Logs `L` + Autopilots
//! `5` screen tripwires landed; 29 once the daemon crash-recovery tripwire
//! landed; 31 once the migration-determinism tripwire and the daemon
//! concurrent-cap tripwire landed; 32 once the retry-chain + timeout e2e
//! tripwire landed; 33 once the create-flow keystroke→RPC→DB round-trip
//! tripwire landed; 34 once the plugin-crash / host-reconnect +
//! parent-death-watcher tripwire landed), per `feedback_dont_guess_test_constants`.
//! When
//! you ADD a tripwire, this test keeps passing (count rises) — but bump the
//! baseline to the new captured count in the same commit. When you INTENTIONALLY
//! remove one, bump the baseline down so the drop is reviewed, never silent.
