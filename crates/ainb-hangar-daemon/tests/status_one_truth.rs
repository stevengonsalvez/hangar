//! D14: one status truth on the `fleet_session` family.
//!
//! Three properties that a second status source silently breaks, each written
//! against the shipped write and read paths rather than a hand-built row:
//!
//! 1. **Tier order holds**, in both halves it has: the store refuses an
//!    inferred observation over an authoritative one even when the inferred
//!    one is newer, and the discovery path labels what it writes `inferred` so
//!    that refusal means what it says. The second half had regressed.
//! 2. **Completion is never derived from silence.** Absence of evidence is not
//!    evidence of completion. This vocabulary has no `done`: the state that
//!    would wrongly claim it is `idle` ("finished its turn and is free"), and
//!    the honest answer for a session nothing has reported on is
//!    `unverifiable`. Asserted over pseudo-random event sequences containing no
//!    terminal event, because the failure mode is a particular ORDER rather
//!    than a particular event, and separately for true silence.
//! 3. **The projection cannot drift.** After a 1,000-event replay, zero rows
//!    where `attention.open` disagrees with `fleet_session.attention_state`.
//!    Both are written by the single apply path in one transaction, so the
//!    only way they diverge is a lost write, which is exactly what
//!    `sweep_once` stopped papering over when it became an assertion.
