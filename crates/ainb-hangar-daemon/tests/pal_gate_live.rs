//! The confirm-card guardrail on the LIVE path: Pal's real MCP tool

//! What is real here that `rpc_fleet_chat` could not be: `rpc_fleet_chat` mints
//! its cards by calling `pal::gate` directly, which proves the gate but not
//! that anything calls it. These tests start at `tools/call` — the MCP entry
//! point the adapter drives — and never touch `pal::gate` by name. A gate
//! nothing invoked would fail every one of them.
//!
//! What is NOT real: the ACP adapter and the model. No process here decides to
//! call a tool; the test issues the calls a model would. That boundary is the
//! honest one — no test can prove what a model chooses, so the guarantee is
//! built the other way round, by making the choice harmless.
//!
//! Proves, in order of the phase's acceptance list:
//!
//! * a confirm-class tool call PARKS a card `fleet/confirm_list` returns;
//! * approving it RESUMES the tool call into a real daemon call;
//! * denying it REFUSES the tool call, with no execution;
//! * an undeclared argument key never reaches the operator's card;
//! * a second answer is refused (single use);
//! * an expired card is not answerable, and the tool resolves denied;
//! * an operator's EDIT is re-classified before it resumes anything;
//! * a hostile transcript, obeyed to the letter, gets no destructive call
//!   without a human and no write wearing the operator's name.
