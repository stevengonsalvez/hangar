//!
//! The Logs screen (`screen/logs.rs`) is a **file read**, not a daemon RPC: it
//! resolves `{home}/.agents-in-a-box/hangar/logs` via
//! [`ainb_hangar_core::logs::default_log_dir`] and tails the newest `daemon.*`
//! file. So this tripwire seeds the daemon's own log artefact directly —
//! [`seed_logs`] appends three known JSON lines (one `INFO` carrying
//! [`LOGS_TRIPWIRE_MARKER`], one `WARN`, one `ERROR`) in the P8.1 wire shape to
//! the newest dated file — then drives `ainb tui` to the Logs pane and asserts
//! the marker message + its `INFO` level token render, plus the level-filter
//! chips. The negative half proves the screen actually switched away from the
//! issue-list landing.
//!
//! SKIP (never fail) when tmux / the built binaries / the staged plugin are
//! absent, per the `tmux-ui-tripwire` skill.

#![allow(clippy::duration_suboptimal_units)] // `from_secs` reads fine as a budget.
