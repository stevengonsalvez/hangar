//! tcp T2 (agents-in-a-box-aau.2) — the card BRANCH + PR surfacing tripwire.
//!
//! The T1 worktree tripwires prove a card runs in a volatile worktree that is
//! torn down clean. This one closes the T2 surfacing gap: a card run whose agent
//! COMMITS in its worktree must leave a durable `ainb/<slug>` branch (surviving
//! `git worktree remove`) that the card SHOWS, and a PR the run "opened" must
//! render a PR chip + CI status on the card — all through the real `ainb tui`.
//!
//! ```text
//!  Boards (B) ─▶ create card on testrepo ─▶ Run ▾ ─▶ headless
//!         │
//!         ▼
//!  claim loop provisions a WORKTREE ─▶ fake agent COMMITS + prints a PR url
//!         │      (branch ainb/<slug> now ahead of base)
//!         ▼
//!  finalize records the branch + captures result.pr_url ─▶ done
//!         │      TaskFinished ─▶ plugin re-pulls tasks_list
//!         ▼      (tasks_list fetches PR status via the STUB gh under HANGAR_GH_PATH)
//!  the card shows  ·ainb/…<last 6>·  and  ·PR ✓·  (branch + PR chip + CI status)
//! ```
//!
//! The PR association is seeded through the REAL plumbing, never real GitHub: the
//! agent prints a canonical `gh pr create` url line (captured by the P9.1 scan)
//! and the daemon's `gh` is a stub (`HANGAR_GH_PATH`) answering a passing /
//! mergeable / open PR. SKIPs cleanly when tmux / the binaries / git / the staged
//! plugin are absent. Follows the `tmux-ui-tripwire` HARD RULES: exact-name kills
//! only, deadline-bounded polls, POSITIVE (branch + PR on the card) + NEGATIVE
//! (neither present before the run) proofs.
