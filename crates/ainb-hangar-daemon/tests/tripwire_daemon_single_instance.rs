//! Process-level tripwire for one-daemon-per-hangar-home.
//!
//! The incident this guards against: 69 `ainb hangar daemon run` processes on one
//! machine, 65 of them orphaned at `ppid==1`, twice exhausting a 32 GB Mac. The
//! cause was a check-then-act guard — a pidfile written at the END of boot and
//! read by a different process BEFORE spawning — so every duplicate booted, and
//! `rpc::bind` unlinked the incumbent's socket on the way past.
//!
//! Unit tests cannot prove this: the defect lives between processes. So these
//! spawn REAL daemon binaries against an isolated `HOME` and assert on the
//! outcomes an operator would see — one survivor, a losing daemon that exits 0,
//! and an incumbent whose socket is never stolen out from under it.
//!
//! Safety (mandatory, mirrors `scripts/soak-codex-orphans.sh`): every daemon here
//! is a child of this test, killed by its EXACT pid via `DaemonProcess`'s drop.
//! No `pkill`, no `killall`, no name matching. `HOME` is pinned and the home
//! overrides removed, so nothing touches the operator's `~/.agents-in-a-box`, and
//! `AINB_CODEX_MANAGED=0` keeps the codex manager (and the desktop Codex app)
//! entirely out of it.
