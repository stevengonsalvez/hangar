//! e38.31 tripwire: plugin crash → host recovers, and host death → no orphan.
//!
//! F40 covers the *daemon* dropping under a live plugin (the host observes a
//! socket disconnect). This tripwire covers the two *inverse* directions that
//! F40 leaves untested, driving the REAL `ainb tui` on the Hangar screen in
//! tmux:
//!
//! ```text
//!  ┌──────────┐   spawns   ┌─────────────┐   dials   ┌────────────┐
//!  │ ainb tui │──────────▶│ hangar-tui   │─────────▶│ hangar     │
//!  │  (host)  │◀── render │ (plugin)     │  socket   │ daemon     │
//!  └──────────┘  pipe     └─────────────┘           └────────────┘
//!       │                       ▲                          ▲
//!       │ leg A: kill -9 plugin │ host stays alive,        │ seeded rows
//!       │                       │ re-renders / clean state │
//!       ▼                       │                          │
//!  leg B: kill -9 HOST ───▶ plugin self-exits (stdin EOF /
//!                           parent-death watcher) — no PPID=1 orphan
//! ```
//!
//! ## Leg A — PLUGIN CRASH → HOST RECOVERS
//!
//! Capture the EXACT hangar-tui plugin child pid (its `comm` is the staged
//! plugin's absolute path; its parent is the EXACT `ainb` host binary), then
//! `kill -9` only that pid. The host's `plugin_task::handle_exit` drains the
//! render ledger with a `RuntimeError`, records the failure, and — because the
//! hangar-tui plugin is `lifecycle.spawn = "lazy"` — re-spawns on the next
//! render kick (a nav keystroke marks the screen dirty). POSITIVE: the host
//! either re-spawns the plugin and re-renders the seeded rows OR shows a clean
//! Hangar chrome (not a crash). NEGATIVE (paired): the host process is still
//! alive (it did NOT die with its child) and the pane is NOT a dead terminal.
//!
//! ## Leg B — HOST DEATH → NO ORPHAN
//!
//! With the plugin alive, `kill -9` the HOST. The host never runs its `Drop`,
//! so the macOS process-group `kill(-pgid)` backstop never fires and
//! `kill_on_drop` is bypassed — without a reaping mechanism the plugin would
//! reparent to `launchd` (PPID = 1) and leak. POSITIVE: the captured plugin pid
//! is gone within a bounded poll. NEGATIVE (paired): no process with the EXACT
//! staged-plugin path survives as an orphan.
//!
//! ### What actually reaps the plugin here (verified, not assumed)
//!
//! Two mechanisms can reap a host-spawned plugin on host death, and this
//! end-to-end test exercises their **union** — the observable, user-visible
//! guarantee (no orphan), not either mechanism in isolation:
//!
//! 1. **stdin-EOF graceful exit** (`server::read_loop` breaks on `Ok(None)`).
//!    The host owns the write end of the plugin's stdin pipe; a `SIGKILL`'d host
//!    has its fd table reaped by the kernel, closing that write end, so the
//!    plugin reads EOF and exits. Measured: this fires within ~0.5 s on macOS
//!    even with the watcher disabled — so it dominates the host-spawned case.
//! 2. **parent-death watcher** (`parent_watch`, commit 8494ad0f, macOS) /
//!    **`PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`** (`process::install_leak_guard`, Linux). The
//!    backstop for the case where the host dies WITHOUT closing the plugin's
//!    stdin (e.g. the write end is held open by a third process). A host-spawned
//!    plugin driven through `ainb tui` cannot reach that case from a tmux test
//!    (the host always owns stdin), so the watcher in **isolation** is covered
//!    by [`ainb_plugin_sdk_rust::parent_watch`]'s own unit tests
//!    (`should_exit`) plus the stdin-still-open isolation test in that crate —
//!    NOT by this end-to-end tripwire.
//!
//! The bounded-vanish assertion holds identically on macOS and Linux, so leg B
//! is NOT cfg-skipped: the user-visible guarantee (no orphaned plugin after host
//! death) is the same on every Unix host and worth defending there.
//!
//! ## Harness reuse + HARD RULES
//!
//! Gating (`can_run_tripwire`/`skip`), seeding/spawn (`prepare_pipeline`), and
//! the tmux driver (`TuiSession`, `open_hangar_and_wait_ready`, `poll_capture`,
//! single-char nav, exact-name `kill-session`) are reused from
//! `tripwire_p4_common`. The crash-specific bits — discovering the EXACT plugin
//! child pid via `ps` (never a name/wildcard match), `kill -9` that exact pid
//! via `nix` — live here. SKIP-not-fail when tmux/binaries/plugin are missing.
//! `--test-threads=1` (the runner enforces it) so the killed processes never
//! race a sibling tripwire's tempdir.

#![allow(clippy::duration_suboptimal_units)] // `from_secs(N)` reads fine as a poll budget.

// Reuse the P4.9 harness for gating + the seed/spawn + tmux driver. `#[path]`
// (not `mod`) so Cargo does not compile the helper file as its own test binary.
