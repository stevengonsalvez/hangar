//! P9.2 — PR badge + open-in-browser tripwire (TRIPWIRE 2).
//!
//! Seeds the P4 fixture, marks its `task-1` (on `issue-1`) `done` with a
//! `result.pr_url`, and launches `ainb tui` with `$HANGAR_OPENER_PROBE_FILE`
//! pointing at a tempfile (flipping the plugin's PR opener to a recording opener
//! that writes the URL instead of launching a browser). It then:
//!
//! 1. opens `issue-1`'s task detail (`Enter` on the first row);
//! 2. `tmux capture-pane` asserts the gold badge row `PR https://example.com/pr/1`
//!    is on screen (POSITIVE), paired with the NEGATIVE that the issue-list
//!    `Todo (3)` chrome is gone (we genuinely navigated);
//! 3. `send-keys o` (single char, NO Enter — HARD RULE 3);
//! 4. asserts the recording-opener probe file contains the badged PR URL,
//!    proving the `o` action fired without a real browser popping up.
//!
//! tmux-ui-tripwire HARD RULES: exact-name `kill-session`, `poll_capture` with a
//! deadline (no bare sleep), single-char nav keys, POSITIVE+NEGATIVE assertions,
//! SKIP-not-fail when the environment can't support the test.
