//! registers on.
//!
//! The hook resolves it through `ainb_plugin_notifyd::paths::Paths::from_home()`
//! (`$AINB_HANGAR_HOME`, else `$AINB_HOME`, else `~/.agents-in-a-box`). The
//! daemon used to resolve it independently from `$AINB_HOME` alone, so any stack
//! running under `$AINB_HANGAR_HOME` posted every Fleet interview answer to the
//! DEFAULT home's broker, a broker that had never seen the session. The answer
//! came back unmatched, Fleet recorded `Claude request no longer waiting`, and
//! the hook stayed blocked until its 600s timeout. Nothing caught it because
//! every other test overrides the socket path instead of resolving it.
//!
//! One test in its own binary: it mutates process env, so it must not share a
//! test process with anything that reads a home (no `ENV_LOCK` can protect
//! against a sibling that does not take it).
