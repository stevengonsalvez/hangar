//! P11 (agents-in-a-box-43e) — the real answer-FLIP e2e tripwire.
//!
//! `tripwire_p2_control_center_attention` renders + navigates the control center
//! and shows the ①②③ options, but NEVER presses a digit to answer — so the flip
//! through the real daemon (answer RPC → C1 live-target resolve → verified tmux
//! delivery → `open`→`answered` → board refresh) was untested end to end. The
//! plugin's `attention_answer_over_socket` proves the `2` keystroke issues an
//! `attention/answer` RPC, but only against a MOCK daemon that fakes the
//! `delivered` outcome. Neither exercises the daemon's real answer router with a
//! live delivery target.
//!
//! That gap was first (and only) driven by the vhs recording harness
//! (`docs/hangar/assets/record-control-center.sh` + `seed_control_center.rs`):
//! a fake `ainb list` binds the seeded ASK's raising session (`s-deploy`) to a
//! real tmux pane and `AINB_FLEET_TRANSPORT=tmux-only` forces the last mile
//! through tmux, so pressing an option digit genuinely delivers the pick and the
//! row flips to `answered`, dropping off the open board. This tripwire turns that
//! recording technique into an assertion:
//!
//!   1. open the control center (`C`) — the seeded 3-option ASK is on top,
//!      `1 need you`, ①②③ options visible;
//!   2. press `2` (answer `prod`) — re-pressed ONLY while the unanswered ASK is
//!      still the selected/answerable card (a stray digit AFTER the flip would
//!      fall through to the tab router and navigate off the control center, per
//!      the `plugin.rs` `Screen::ControlCenter` digit guard);
//!   3. the board flips to `0 need you` (the `AttentionAnswered` delta round-trips
//!      back to the TUI — the daemon only keeps the row answered on a CONFIRMED
//!      tmux delivery, so `0 need you` proves resolve + flip + delivery);
//!   4. the picked option lands in the target pane (the last mile the board flip
//!      alone can't show);
//!   5. the DB row deterministically reads `answered` carrying `prod`.
//!
//! Runs for real when tmux + the built binaries + the staged plugin are present;
//! SKIPs gracefully otherwise (see `tripwire_p4_common.rs`).
