//! tcp T3 (agents-in-a-box-aau.3) — the card-RERUN lifecycle tripwire (F6).
//!
//! Rerun rides the existing `Enter` → `Run ▾` affordance: pressing it on a
//! FINISHED card must enqueue a FRESH task (a new `agent_task_queue` row, a new
//! `ainb/<slug>` worktree), respecting the per-(issue, agent) claim guard — a
//! second run only lands because the first is terminal. This tripwire proves the
//! second run is genuinely fresh (a DISTINCT task short-id + its own branch) and
//! greens the card again, all through the real `ainb tui`.
//!
//! ```text
//!  create card ─▶ Run ▾ ─▶ headless ─▶ run #1 commits ─▶ done (slug1, ainb/<slug1>)
//!         │
//!         ▼   (card terminal → claim guard lets a fresh run enqueue)
//!  Enter ─▶ Run ▾ ─▶ headless ─▶ run #2 (slug2 ≠ slug1, ainb/<slug2>) ─▶ done
//! ```
//!
//! The committing fake-agent exits on its own (non-blocking), so each run
//! finalizes to `done` and its clean worktree tears down while the durable branch
//! survives — the DISTINCT `ainb/<slug2>` branch is the proof the rerun
//! provisioned a fresh worktree, not a re-run of the first. SKIPs cleanly when
//! tmux / the binaries / the staged plugin are absent. Follows the
//! `tmux-ui-tripwire` HARD RULES: exact-name kills only, deadline-bounded polls.

    // stays behind on the now-empty Todo column, so the rerun leg has to move

    // sleeps, which assumes the card has already landed and that no keypress
    // dropped; when either failed, focus stopped on an empty column and this
    // loop pressed `Enter` at nothing until it timed out.

    // A "nudge right when the pane shows the empty placeholder" is NOT the fix
    // either, and I shipped that mistake once: `— empty —` is painted for EVERY

    // screen, and the nudge walks focus straight past the card to the last
    // column (the board clamps there) on every iteration.
