//! P8.7 e2e tripwire 1 — the Kanban board (`K`) renders its four columns with

//!
//! Reuses the proven P4 pipeline ([`tripwire_p4_common`]): an isolated `$HOME`
//! whose `hangar.db` is seeded with the P4 fixture, a daemon spawned against it
//! (RPC-only — `HANGAR_DAEMON_DISABLE_CLAIM=1`), and `ainb tui` launched under
//! the same `$HOME`. On top of the fixture's single `running` task this seeds one
//! `queued`, one `done`, and one `failed` task ([`seed_kanban_spread`]) so every
//! one of the board's four columns holds a card.
//!
//! The board's real column labels (read from `screen/kanban.rs`) are
//! `queued` / `running` / `done` / `failed`, each rendered as `<label> (<count>)`.
//! The card identifier is `#<short_id>` where `short_id` is the task id's last 6
//! chars — the seed ids end in unique `kq0001` / `kd0002` / `kf0003` suffixes so
//! the rendered `#kq0001` token is greppable and never aliases a column header.
//!
//! SKIP (never fail) when tmux / the built binaries / the staged plugin are
//! absent, per the `tmux-ui-tripwire` skill.

#![allow(clippy::duration_suboptimal_units)] // `from_secs` reads fine as a budget.
