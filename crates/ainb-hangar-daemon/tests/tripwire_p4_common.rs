//! P4.9 — shared seed/spawn helpers for the per-screen TUI tripwires.
//!
//! Lives as `tests/tripwire_p4_common.rs` and is `#[path]`-included by each
//! `tripwire_p4_*` test (rather than a `mod` under `tests/`, which Cargo would
//! compile as its own test binary). It codifies the `tmux-ui-tripwire` skill's
//! HARD RULES:
//!
//! - exact-name `tmux kill-session` only (never `kill-server`/`pkill`/wildcard);
//! - `poll_capture` with a deadline + predicate (no bare `sleep` before capture);
//! - single-char nav keys sent WITHOUT `Enter`;
//! - POSITIVE marker paired with a NEGATIVE placeholder assertion (never a
//!   substring-OR on chrome strings);
//! - SKIP-not-fail when the environment can't support the test.
//!
//! ## What the pipeline looks like now (P4.10 closed the gaps)
//!
//! ```text
//! seed hangar.db ──▶ ainb-hangar-daemon (binds $HOME/.agents-in-a-box/hangar.sock)
//!                            ▲ snapshot RPCs
//!  ainb tui (tmux) ──`g`──▶ HANGAR PluginScreen ──▶ hangar-tui plugin ──dial──┘
//! ```
//!
//! [`prepare_pipeline`] seeds an isolated `$HOME`'s `hangar.db` with the P4
//! fixture and spawns the daemon against it; [`TuiSession::spawn`] launches
//! `ainb tui` (plugins active) under the same `$HOME` and presses `g` to open the
//! Hangar screen. [`can_run_tripwire`] gates on tmux + both binaries + the staged
//! plugin, SKIPping (never failing) when any is missing.

#![allow(dead_code)]
// each tripwire uses a subset of these helpers.
// `Duration::from_secs(60)` reads fine as a poll budget; `from_mins` is unstable.
// Same rationale as `run_loop.rs`'s crate-level allow.
