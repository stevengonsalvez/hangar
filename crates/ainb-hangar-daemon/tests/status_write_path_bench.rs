//! Spike-8 gate for the D14 write path: one transaction per event, at 100
//! sessions and 10 events/s, stays at or below 15 ms p99 WITH the attention
//! projection inside the apply transaction.
//!
//! Spike 8 measured the proposal at 11.21 ms p99 over a 20-minute run
//! (`research/2026-09-11_multi-surface_SPIKE-8-sqlite-write-path.md`, run A)
//! against a prototype. This measures the shipped code, which is the thing that
//! can regress: `FleetRepo::apply_event_with_attention` now writes the Fleet
//! event, the session state and the inbox card under one write lock, so a
//! mistake there shows up as commit latency rather than as a correctness bug.
//!
//! # The rate is part of the gate, not a detail to optimise away
//!
//! Running the events back to back looks like a strictly harsher test that
//! would finish in seconds. It is not, and the difference is large. Measured on
//! this write path:
//!
//! | arrivals | p50 | p99 | max |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | unthrottled, 2,000 events | 1.53 ms | 109.72 ms | 1,157.86 ms |
//! | 50/s, 2,000 events | 1.57 ms | 137.68 ms | 1,135.67 ms |
//! | **10/s, 900 events** | **1.49 ms** | **12.68 ms** | 90.69 ms |
//!
//! p50 is flat across all three, so the apply itself costs the same everywhere.
//! The tail is SQLite's automatic WAL checkpoint, which fires every 1,000 pages
//! and therefore scales with the WRITE RATE: at 10/s it lands on roughly 2 of
//! 900 commits, at 50/s on far more. A faster run does not bound a slower one,
//! it measures a different system.
//!
//! So the run is paced at the rate the spec names, and takes the ~90 seconds
//! that honestly costs. `AINB_BENCH_RATE_PER_SEC` and `AINB_BENCH_EVENTS`
//! override both, so spike 8's own run A (10/s for 20 minutes) is reproducible
//! without editing this file.
