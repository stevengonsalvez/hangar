//! P5.5 — workspace switch tripwire (tmux-driven, end-to-end).
//!
//! Drives the real `ainb tui` against a seeded two-workspace hangar:
//!
//! 1. open Settings (`,`),
//! 2. navigate to the Workspace pane (`j` to the 4th section),
//! 3. select the second workspace row (`]`),
//! 4. press `s` to set it active,
//! 5. assert the pane re-renders with the second workspace marked active
//!    (its `▶` slug indicator) and the daemon-side switch state followed.
//! 6. (e38.26) switch back to the Issues tab (`1`) and assert the issue list
//!    now shows the SECOND workspace's issue and never the first's — proving
//!    the switch re-scopes the DATA plane, not just the active `▶` marker.
//!
//! Honours the `tmux-ui-tripwire` HARD RULES via the shared P4 harness
//! ([`tripwire_p4_common`]): exact-name `tmux kill-session` only, `poll_capture`
//! (no bare sleep), single-char nav without `Enter`, POSITIVE paired with a
//! NEGATIVE assertion, and SKIP-not-fail when tmux / the binaries / the staged
//! plugin are missing.
//!
//! The seed is the P4 fixture PLUS a second workspace inserted here (the shared
//! fixture seeds one workspace; switching needs two). Workspace A (the fixture's
//! `default`) carries `Refactor API`; workspace B (`acme`) carries
//! `Acme Login Bug` — distinct issues so the post-switch data assertion can tell
//! the two tenants' issue lists apart. The second workspace's slug is the
//! on-screen marker the active switch is asserted against; with `id != slug`
//! (mirroring real workspaces) the assertion can't be masked by an `id == slug`
//! fixture.
