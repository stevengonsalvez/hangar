//! The sparkline's data is the daemon's **in-memory** throughput ring (P8.5),
//! which is populated only by the FSM finalize path on real task completion. So
//! this drives the data the REAL way: a claim-enabled daemon executes a batch of
//! seeded tasks through a deterministic fake-`claude`
//! ([`fake_claude_mixed`](common::fake_claude_mixed)) — the first run fails
//! (`record_failed` → the sparkline's red band), the rest succeed
//! (`record_completed` → green) — then the `D` screen snapshots the ring.
//!
//! Assertions (positive + negative, per the `tmux-ui-tripwire` skill):
//!   * POSITIVE: at least one of the eight unicode block glyphs `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█` is on
//!     the pane (the sparkline rendered a non-empty column), AND the pane chrome
//!     (`Daemon health`, `throughput (60s):`) is present.
//!   * POSITIVE: an escaped (`-e`) capture carries a truecolor **red** SGR for
//!     the sparkline's failure accent (`38;2;220;120;100`). If no red escape is
//!     observed (terminal/tmux escape-emission differences) the assertion softens
//!     to "block chars + health chrome rendered" — documented below.
//!   * NEGATIVE: the pane is NOT the Hangar issue-list landing screen (proves the
//!     `D` switch actually happened).
//!
//! SKIP (never fail) when tmux / binaries / the staged plugin are absent.
