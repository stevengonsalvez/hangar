//! The plain-task issue lifecycle: `hangar/issues_list` `state` must walk
//! `todo -> in_progress -> done` as a dispatched task walks its FSM.
//!
//! The default hangar issue board buckets cards by `issue.state` alone (the
//! `issues_list` snapshot serves it verbatim), while the board auto-move only
//! touches durable `board_card` rows the default screen never materialises. So a
//! plain dispatched task used to walk its FSM (`running -> done`) with its issue
//! frozen at `open`/`todo`, stranding its card in Todo through the whole run and
//! after it finished. The fix advances `issue.state` at the same FSM seams the
//! board auto-move fires — [`board::advance_issue_lifecycle_after_transition`] on
//! the `running` transition, [`board::advance_issue_lifecycle_after_terminal`] on
//! the terminal drain — so the snapshot renders the right column.
//!
//! These tests assert the SNAPSHOT the plugin actually reads (not the raw row),
//! prove the advance-only guard never regresses a terminal state, and prove a
//! FAILED task never marks its issue `done`. Removing the `IssueRepo::update_state`
//! call in `board::advance_issue_lifecycle_after_transition` turns the first test
//! red (the mutation spot-check).
