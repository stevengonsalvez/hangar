//! P4.9 — issue-list tripwire: `g` lands on the seeded issue list.
//!
//! Asserts the seeded `Refactor API` title and the `Todo (3)` status-group count
//! render (POSITIVE markers), paired with a NEGATIVE placeholder check that we are
//! not stuck on a loading/empty screen. Forward (`g` → hangar issue list) is
//! paired with a return navigation (`,` → settings → `1` → back to issue list)
//! so a one-way key swallow can't pass silently. The settings hop is detected on
//! a Settings-body-only marker (`Providers`), not the persistent tab strip — the
//! `[D]Daemon` tab entry P8.5 added is present on every screen.
//!
//! Runs for real when tmux + the built binaries + the staged plugin are present;
//! SKIPs gracefully otherwise (see `tripwire_p4_common.rs`).
