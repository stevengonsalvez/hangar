//! Wire schema for the `sessions.usage_data` event.
//!
//! Two plugins share this crate:
//!
//! * `ainb-plugin-session-reader` (Phase 6b) — owns parsing, publishes
//!   `sessions.usage_data` carrying a [`UsageDataEvent`].
//! * `ainb-plugin-burndown` (Phase 6c onwards) — subscribes to that
//!   topic and renders / formats from the same types.
//!
//! Wire encoding is rmp-serde (msgpack) with **externally-tagged**
//! enums (no `#[serde(tag = "kind")]`) — that combination round-trips
//! cleanly through rmp-serde for unit, struct, and newtype variants
//! alike. See `reference_rmp_serde_internally_tagged_primitives` and
//! `reference_serde_nested_tag_collision` for why the alternative
//! shapes blow up at encode/decode.
//!
//! Schema versioning lives on the envelope ([`UsageDataEvent::version`])
//! and is bumped whenever a field is added/removed/renamed in a way
//! consumers must care about. Decoders refuse mismatched versions.
