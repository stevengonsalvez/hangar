//! One status truth for every surface (spec D14, phase T0-daemon).
//!
//! The TUI fleet panel, `ainb fleet needs`, `ainb-web`'s `/api/needs` and later
//! the desktop and the phone must show ONE row per agent with the SAME state.
//! Today they do not: the CLI folds `current_state` with a live tmux
//! `classify()` fallback, the web dashboard maps `attention/list`, and the panel
//! renders `fleet/snapshot`. Three readers, three vocabularies, three answers
//! for one agent.
//!
//! This module is the single derivation. It is deliberately PURE: it takes a
//! [`FleetSession`] and whether the inbox holds an open card for it, and returns
//! the row every surface renders, so "same state everywhere" is a property of
//! one function rather than an agreement between three codebases that drift.
//!
//! # Why tier and provenance travel with the state
//!
//! A state without its evidence is not comparable. Six tiers observe a session
//! (hook push > ACP feed > OSC frame > process > transcript > pane text) and
//! only tiers 0 and 1 may open a turn or assert that a human is needed. Carrying
//! the tier is what lets a surface say "waiting, on hook evidence, 3s old"
//! rather than "waiting" and leave the operator to guess whether a pane-scrape
//! guessed it.
//!
//! # Why there is no `done`
//!
//! Silence is not completion. An agent that stops emitting may have finished, or
//! its hook may have failed, or its pane may have been rebuilt. The vocabulary
//! below therefore has no `done`: a finished turn is [`AgentState::Idle`] (the
//! agent is free, and we saw it become free), and an absence of evidence is
//! [`AgentState::Unverifiable`] (we still hold the pane, but nothing has told us
//! anything). No sequence of events ending in silence can produce a state that
//! claims the work is complete.
