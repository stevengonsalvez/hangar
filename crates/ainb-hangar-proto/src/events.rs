//! Typed Hangar event stream payloads.
//!
//! The daemon pushes domain events to subscribed plugins as JSON-RPC
//! *notifications* (`{jsonrpc, method, params}`, no `id`).
//!
//! The `params` of an event notification is a serialised [`HangarEvent`]: an
//! internally-tagged enum whose `event` discriminant is the wire contract the
//! plugin's `StreamClient` keys on.
//!
//! These are **pure wire types** — `serde` + the IO-free id newtypes from
//! [`ainb_hangar_core`] + `chrono` timestamps, nothing host-side. The plugin
//! "owns zero domain data": it borrows these row shapes to render the rows it
//! pulls over RPC, but the source of truth is the daemon's `SQLite` store.
//!
//! Per `reference_msgpack_byte_determinism_vec_over_hashmap`, no field here is
//! a `HashMap` (whose iteration order varies per process and would break
//! byte-deterministic golden tests); every payload is a field-ordered struct.
