//! Settings-screen wire snapshots (`hangar/health`, providers, keys, workspaces).
//!
//! The settings screen (P4.7) renders four sections from daemon RPC snapshots:
//! the daemon health, the registered LLM providers, the (masked) stored keys, and
//! the workspaces the caller can switch to. These are **pure wire types** —
//! `serde` only, no host deps — matching the rest of `ainb-hangar-proto`.
//!
//! No key *material* ever rides these types: [`KeyRow`] carries only a
//! pre-masked display string. The real secret flows through the
//! `host/secret_store_get` capability and the plugin-side `KeyMaterial` newtype
//! (whose `Debug` redacts), never over this snapshot.
