//! The ONE wire-protocol integer and the ONE capability catalogue (D17).
//!
//! Two different questions used to be answered by two different numbers, and a
//! client had no way to ask the first one at all:
//!
//! * *"can this build talk to that build?"*, answered here, by
//!   [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`] carried as a `{min, max}` range in `auth/hello`.
//! * *"does that build serve the method I am about to call?"*, answered by a
//!   capability string in [`CAPABILITY_CATALOGUE`].
//!
//! ```text
//! client ──auth/hello { protocol: {min,max}, capabilities }──▶ daemon
//!        ◀─{ protocol: {min,max}, selected, capabilities }──── overlap or 4409
//! ```
//!
//! ## Bump rule
//!
//! [`PROTOCOL_VERSION`] bumps ONLY when a peer that does not know about the
//! change would misread the wire:
//!
//! * a method or a field is REMOVED,
//! * a field's MEANING changes,
//! * framing, auth, or crypto changes.
//!
//! A new method, a new optional field, and a new event kind are NOT bumps,
//! they are capability strings. That rule is what lets an app-store phone keep
//! working: it cannot be force-upgraded, so the integer has to move rarely
//! enough that the range overlap survives a release the user never installed.
//!
//! ## Why the fleet integer does not move
//!
//! [`crate::fleet::FLEET_PROTOCOL_VERSION`] is frozen at 2 forever and
//! `fleet/negotiate` stays as a compatibility echo. Two integers would be worse
//! than none: a client would have to reason about which one governs a given
//! frame. The fleet capability ids are therefore APPENDED to the one catalogue
//! here, and `fleet/negotiate` keeps answering its own subset for the clients
//! that already call it.
