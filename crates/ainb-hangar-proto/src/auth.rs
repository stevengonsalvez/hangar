//! Connection-auth frame shape for the daemon's unix-socket RPC server.
//!
//! The daemon requires the **first frame** of every socket connection to be an
//! [`crate::methods::AUTH_HELLO`] request carrying the minted daemon token in
//! its params. This module is the single shared definition of that frame so
//! the daemon and every client (the hangar-tui plugin, test harnesses) agree
//! on the wire shape byte-for-byte.
//!
//! ## Handshake
//!
//! ```text
//! client                          daemon
//!   │  auth/hello {token}  ──────▶ │ verify sha256(token) vs stored hash
//!   │ ◀──────  {} ok               │ (constant-time, core::token::verify)
//!   │  workspace/subscribe ──────▶ │ normal dispatch from here on
//! ```
//!
//! An unauthenticated or wrong-token connection receives a JSON-RPC error
//! with code [`UNAUTHORIZED`] and the daemon closes the connection.
//!
//! ## Token handoff
//!
//! The daemon mints the token on boot (if absent), stores only its SHA-256
//! hex digest in the database, and writes the plaintext **once** to
//! `{hangar_home}/hangar/daemon.token` with `0600` permissions. Clients read
//! that file ([`default_token_file`]) and present its contents verbatim.
