//! Request params + result wrappers for the P4 `hangar/*` snapshot RPCs.
//!
//! Each snapshot RPC carries a `{ workspace_id }` request (except
//! [`crate::methods::HANGAR_HEALTH`], which is workspace-agnostic) and answers
//! with a thin envelope wrapping the row vec the corresponding screen renders
//! from. The row types themselves ([`crate::events::IssueRow`],
//! [`crate::events::ActorRow`], [`crate::events::SkillRow`],
//! [`crate::settings::HealthSnapshot`]) live next to the event/settings wire
//! types; this module only adds the request/response envelopes so the daemon
//! handler and the plugin client agree on the exact JSON shape.
//!
//! These are **pure wire types** — `serde` only, no host deps — matching the
//! rest of `ainb-hangar-proto`.
