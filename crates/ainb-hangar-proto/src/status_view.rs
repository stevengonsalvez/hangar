//! The agent-status view every surface renders from (D14, T0-section, #1015).
//!
//! One pure reducer over `fleet/roster_status` replies, run by section 20 of the
//! app state (and so by the desktop and the phone through W0-mirror). The TUI
//! Fleet panel, in the hangar plugin, receives the folded view whole on the
//! host's agent-status topic (`status_topic`, #1031) instead of folding reads
//! of its own. Two surfaces folding the same replies through two reducers is
//! exactly the drift D14 removes, so neither keeps one of its own.
//!
//! ```text
//!  fleet/roster_status ──▶ StatusView::apply ──▶ cards + health ──▶ render
//!  read failed         ──▶ StatusView::mark_unreachable (rows frozen)
//!  newer fleet event   ──▶ StatusView::observe_head      (Stale until read)
//! ```
//!
//! Deliberately no `Serialize`: section 20 must not be serialised until the
//! redaction layer exists (#983). The rows it holds are wire types, but the view
//! itself is a local fold.
