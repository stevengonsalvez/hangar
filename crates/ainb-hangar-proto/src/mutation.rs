//! The mutation envelope: one op id, one fence, one vocabulary (D18).
//!
//! Every mutation on this wire carries a client-minted opaque op id and, where
//! the mutation has a thing it is racing against, a fence naming the state the
//! client believed it was acting on. The daemon commits, THEN replies, and the
//! reply says which of three things happened to the operation and which of
//! three things happened to the request:
//!
//! ```text
//! op id ──▶ ledger lookup ─┬─ miss  ──▶ execute ──▶ commit ──▶ created
//!                          ├─ hit, same body ─────────────────▶ replayed
//!                          ├─ hit, other body ────────────────▶ rejected{already_answered_by}
//!                          └─ hit, other principal ───────────▶ rejected{op_id_foreign}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why a client-minted id and not a server one
//!
//! The failure this exists for is a LOST REPLY: the daemon committed, the
//! socket died, the client retried. A server-minted id is not in the client's
//! hand at retry time, so it cannot name the operation it is retrying. A
//! client-minted opaque id can, and is the only thing that can.
//!
//! ## Two tiers, deliberately
//!
//! 1. [`MutationTier::Dedupe`]: every mutation. The ledger stores the
//!    serialized reply; a replay returns it byte-for-byte. This is enough
//!    whenever the only cost of a double execution is a duplicated row.
//! 2. [`MutationTier::Receipt`]: the PTY-effecting mutations only. These type
//!    into somebody's terminal, so a double execution is a second `yes` on an
//!    agent about to run a command. They carry a receipt whose lifecycle is
//!    written in the SAME `SQLite` transaction as the state flip, never through
//!    the event outbox (which has a documented crash loss window).
//!
//! Adding a handler to tier 2 is a checklist item, not the default.
//!
//! ## Op ids are opaque
//!
//! 128 bits of client CSPRNG, conventionally rendered as 32 lowercase hex
//! characters. The daemon NEVER parses one: no timestamp is read out of it, so
//! a phone with a wrong clock is never rejected for skew, and no freshness rule
//! can be invented later without changing this type. The fleet family's
//! existing `request_id` IS the op id for that family
//! (`FleetActionParams::request_id`, `FleetMessageSendParams::request_id`,
//! `FleetStartParams::request_id`); W0-wire renames nothing on the wire and
//! accepts `op_id` as the alias.
