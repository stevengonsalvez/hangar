/// transcript's chunks are, because the frame is the boundary and the fold is
/// not. `absent` and `unreachable` are the host's own reasons, which can carry

/// less the reserve the scalar fields need, and the rest are counted in
/// `rows_cut`. A section past `MAX_FRAME_BYTES` is withheld whole, and a
/// withheld inbox has no counter to say why.
