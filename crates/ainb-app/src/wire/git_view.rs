// ABOUTME: The bounded projection of the git view, which is what a frame
// carries. The section holds a whole diff twice, as `diff_content` and again as
// the review rows, and a section body past `MAX_FRAME_BYTES` is withheld WHOLE
// (`frame.rs`), which would take the file tree and the commit box with it. So
// the frame carries a window of each, and says how much it cut.
//
//   state (whole diff, the TUI paints it) ──▶ scrub ──▶ cut ──▶ spend ──▶ frame
//                                                                 │
//                                        diff_lines_cut, rows_cut, files_cut
//
// Two bounds, because counts alone do not hold: 2,000 diff lines and 4,000
// review rows of 2,000 characters is 11 MiB before escaping, and a control
// character costs six bytes encoded. So the counts stop any one source crowding
// out the others, and one BYTE budget ([`MAX_TEXT_BYTES`]) is what actually
// keeps the section inside the ceiling whatever the content is. The budget
// degrades the section, counting what it dropped; it never withholds it.
//
// It is spent in the order a person reads: the review file they are looking at,
// then the diff, then the rest of the review, then markdown, then the lists. So
// the open file never frames zero rows because a diff elsewhere ate the budget.
//
// Scrub BEFORE cut, never after: a key block spans rows (`redact::scrub_lines`
// carries an `in_key` flag across lines), so cutting first could frame the tail
// of a credential whose opening line was dropped. For the same reason the scrub
// runs over a whole file's rows and over the whole markdown document, not over
// one hunk or one line at a time.
//
// The projection is owned rather than a borrowed serializer, so the same types
// carry the TypeScript bindings: a field the window reads cannot drift from the
// field the frame writes.
