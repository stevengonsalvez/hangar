// ABOUTME: Section 21 `usage` as a frame carries it: a fold of the daemon's
// `fleet/usage_summary` reply (D3p-e), bounded whatever the daemon sent.
//
//   reply ──bound (section)──▶ held ──scrub──▶ cut ──▶ frame
//                 │
//      daily_cut, providers_cut, models_cut, projects_cut
//
// The verb already caps its lists (30 days, 10 per breakdown) and its detail
// (1,024 bytes); the section applies the same caps again, because a frame's
// bound cannot rest on the peer keeping its word, and counts what each list
// lost. Every string here is free text from the producer's view (a model id, a
// project key, a repo, a detail message), so each is scrubbed and then cut,
// never cut first: a cut through a credential leaves a prefix no shape
// matches. Names also lose their control characters, which draw nothing and
// cost six bytes each once escaped. With every field capped the section has a
// ceiling, [`USAGE_FRAME_MAX_BYTES`], that a test builds the worst case of.
//
// The projection is owned rather than borrowed so the same types carry the
// TypeScript bindings.
