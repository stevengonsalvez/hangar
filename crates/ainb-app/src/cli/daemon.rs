// ABOUTME: `ainb daemon <kind> <start|stop|restart>` — one uniform lifecycle
// surface over every daemon in the Daemons view.
//
// Before this, each daemon had its own bespoke verbs (or none): ATC had
// `setup`/`teardown`/`repair`, notifyd had `restart`, the MCP pool had only a
// foreground `daemon` plus `stop`, and the fleet daemon and phone bridge had no
// way to be restarted at all. The Daemons screen needs ONE verb set it can put
// behind every row, and the operator needs the same verbs from a terminal.
//
// This module is that surface. It does not reimplement any lifecycle: each
// action delegates to the machinery that already owns it — in-process where a
// function exists, and as a child `ainb …` invocation where the existing
// subcommand is the only implementation. The delegation is deliberate: the TUI
// shells this command and shows its stderr verbatim in the row's error view, so
// whatever the underlying verb reports is what the user reads.
