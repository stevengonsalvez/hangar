// ABOUTME: Version-stamped sections of `AppState`. Every `&mut` access to a
// section bumps its counter, so a surface can ask "what changed since I last
// looked" with one integer compare per section instead of diffing state.
//
// This only means anything because the draw path no longer mutates core state
// (Phase 3 moved renderer-local state into `UiState` and put `Screen::render`
// behind `&AppState`). Before that, every frame bumped everything and the
// counters would have said "all 19 changed" forever.

use std::ops::{Deref, DerefMut};

/// A section of [`crate::app::state::AppState`] with a change counter.
///
/// `DerefMut` is the whole design: any code that takes `&mut` through it bumps
/// the version, whether or not it goes on to write. Over-bumping costs a
/// surface one redundant send; under-bumping loses an update, which is why the
/// bump lives on the borrow rather than on an explicit `set`.
