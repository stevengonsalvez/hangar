// ABOUTME: The 20 sections AppState is grouped into. Each one sits behind a
// `Versioned<T>` on AppState, so any `&mut` access bumps that section alone.
//
// The grouping is the field audit from the plan (2026-09-05-desktop-p0-surface-safety.md
// at Phase 2), refreshed against the struct as it stands: three fields the plan
// named have since moved to `UiState` or gone, and seventeen that did not exist
// when it was written are placed here for the first time.
