// ABOUTME: Interactive session manager for host-based Docker-free sessions
//
// Manages the lifecycle of Interactive mode sessions which run directly on the host:
// - Creates git worktrees for branch isolation
// - Starts tmux sessions for terminal multiplexing
// - Runs claude CLI directly on the host
// - Discovers existing sessions by scanning tmux
//
// This manager is completely independent of Docker and ContainerManager,
// enabling lightweight, fast development workflows.
