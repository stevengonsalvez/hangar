// ABOUTME: The open conversation as a frame carries it: a bounded, scrubbed
// window the reducer writes on its tick, so a renderer in another process can
// draw the thread without holding the chat host.
//
// The host itself (`ChatHost`, and the `ChatState` it drives) stays in
// `HostOnlyState`: it owns a poll loop, an inbox shared with workers and an
// unsent draft, none of which crosses a process boundary. What crosses is this
// projection, built the way #1131 built the attention merge: the reducer
// writes it, every host ticks it, and nothing is re-derived on a render path.
//
// Two rules hold the shape together:
//
//   BOUNDED   every list is capped and every text is cut, here, before serde
//             sees it, so `MAX_FRAME_BYTES` cannot be reached by a long
//             conversation or one enormous tool argument.
//   SCRUBBED  every field that can carry what a person or an agent wrote goes
//             through a scrubber from `wire::fields`, because a conversation
//             is exactly where a pasted credential ends up.
