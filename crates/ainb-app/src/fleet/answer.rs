// ABOUTME: The `ask` tab's answer machine — pick, compose, send, and say what
// happened.
//
// The chip told the operator a session needed them; this is the part that lets
// them do something about it. Two transports, chosen by the row not by a
// setting:
//
// ```text
//   daemon row  ──▶ attention/answer  ──▶ first-answer-wins + the daemon's own
//                                        verified last-mile send
//   local row   ──▶ fleet-core send   ──▶ the session's own pane, which is what
//                                        keeps this working with no daemon
// ```
//
// The state machine is PURE and lives here; the IO is two blocking calls in
// `control` dispatched on a worker. That split is what lets every rule below —
// which key moves the cursor, what a failed send does to the chip, whether a
// second Enter can double-send — be tested without a socket or a pane.
