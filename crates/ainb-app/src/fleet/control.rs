// ABOUTME: Host Fleet subscription, daemon health, and detached control RPCs.
//
// The sessions screen lets the human ACT on what a session needs: answer an
// interview (ASK), decide a permission request, or send a message. The send
// itself is async (`fleet::send::send`, the same tmux send-keys path `fleet
// broadcast` uses) and the TUI key path is sync, so this module owns the
// bridge: a detached worker thread builds a current-thread tokio runtime,
// discovers the live session matching the row, sends the text, and publishes a
// human-readable outcome into a shared cell the surface renders.
//
// Living outside `src/components/` keeps the (legitimately async) send logic
// clear of the render-thread `.await` lint — the worker thread is NOT the
// render path; the component only ever touches the shared feedback cell under a
// microsecond lock.
//
// SAFETY (C1): an ASK answer must reach the EXACT agent that asked. The hook's
// claude session id usually differs from a discovered `Session.id`, so an exact
// id match often fails and we'd fall to a cwd correlation — but two agents can
// share a cwd, so a cwd guess could send the answer to the WRONG agent. We
// therefore REFUSE to answer on an ambiguous cwd (more than one discovered
// session in that cwd, or a merged session that aggregated 2+ sources) rather
// than silently mis-route a safety-critical interview answer. Broadcasts apply
// the same guard (a ping to the wrong agent is lower-harm, but we still refuse —
// the safe call).
//
// CONCURRENCY (C3): each dispatch refuses while another is in flight (an
// `AtomicBool` guard) so key-repeat can't spawn unbounded worker threads or
// double-send an answer to an agent.
