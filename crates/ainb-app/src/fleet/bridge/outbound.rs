// ABOUTME: Proactive outbound — push a newly-open attention request to the phone.
//
// The converged control plane (D18) turns the bridge two-way: as well as
// relaying an inbound chat message into a session, it now watches the daemon's
// open attention inbox and PUSHES a "session X asks: … ①②③" message to the
// configured channel the instant a new ASK / escalation appears — so the human
// learns a session needs input without opening the TUI.
//
// This module owns the PURE half (the event → message formatting and the
// already-notified de-dupe) plus the channel-agnostic dispatch over a `Notifier`
// seam. The live loop polls `daemon::DaemonClient::attention_list_fleet`, diffs
// against the set it has already pushed, and notifies the fresh rows. The
// formatting + de-dupe are unit-tested without a socket or a live channel, and
// `poll_once` is tested end-to-end against a fake daemon socket.
//
// EVERY tick reports to the shared `BridgeHeartbeat`: a success stamps
// `last_attention_poll_at`, a failure logs at WARN with the socket path and
// stamps `last_attention_error`. That is the only signal by which the health
// probe can tell "the chat gateway is connected" (which says nothing about the
// phone getting anything) from "this bridge can actually reach the fleet".
//
// Reaching the daemon is only HALF the contract, though, and the weaker half.
// The tick also reports the DELIVERY outcome: `Notifier::notify` returns a
// `Result`, a row is recorded in the already-pushed set ONLY once its message
// actually reached a channel, and a failure stamps `last_delivery_error` so the
// probe degrades the row. Without that, a poll that reached the daemon while
// every Discord/Slack/Telegram send 429'd would mark the ask delivered (never
// retried, because the row stays open and the seen-set keeps it forever),
// stamp LAST ACTIVITY for work that did not happen, and render as
// "running + connected (outbound push live)" while the human got nothing.
