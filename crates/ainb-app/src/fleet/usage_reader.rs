//! The usage reader: the task that keeps section 21 (usage) current from the
//! daemon's `fleet/usage_summary` (D3p-e).
//!
//! `ainb-app` reduces and the host owns the socket, so the host spawns this
//! task and folds what it reports on its own loop, as it does the agent status
//! reader. The counters have one producer, the daemon's usage projection, and
//! this task only carries its reply: it reads the trailing thirty days, on the
//! cadence the daemon refreshes at, since asking faster returns the same bytes.
//!
//! ```text
//!  daemon ──usage_summary──▶ task ──Read(reply)──▶ mpsc ──▶ drain_into ──▶ section 21
//!  no fleet.usage.read      ──Absent(reason)──▶
//!  read or dial failed      ──Failed(reason)──▶ (numbers kept, and why)
//! ```
//!
//! A summary still `scanning` is asked again on a short cadence, so the first
//! numbers appear once the daemon's first scan lands rather than fifteen
//! minutes later. Failures never become a state: a failed read keeps the last
//! numbers and says why, and the task retries on a bounded backoff. It is
//! panic-free, because the TUI's panic handler tears the terminal down.
