// ABOUTME: The Pal pane's offer to start the hangar daemon it needs, and
// what that start actually reported.
//
// The pane it sits on can only fail one way that an operator can fix from the
// keyboard: the daemon behind every one of its four calls is not running. Every
// other failure is the daemon's own words, and this offers nothing for those —
// a key that starts a second daemon while the first is merely slow is a worse
// surface than the error it replaced.
//
// It owns no lifecycle of its own. The start is the SAME
// `Effect::RunDaemonAction` the Daemons screen queues, run and reported by the
// same host code, so the two cannot drift in what they run or in what they
// report having run.
