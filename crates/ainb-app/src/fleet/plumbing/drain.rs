// ABOUTME: The synchronous Stop-hook drain decision — turns undrained child
// completions into the parent's next turn via Claude Code's `{"decision":"block"}`.
//
// Claude Code's `Stop` hook can return JSON on stdout. When it returns
// `{"decision":"block","reason":"<text>"}` Claude does NOT end the turn — it
// feeds `reason` back into the session as the next thing to act on. That is the
// mechanism that makes a parent (e.g. ATC) learn the instant a child finishes:
// the child's completion lands in the parent's inbox, and the parent's own Stop
// hook drains it and blocks with the completion text, so the parent immediately
// acts instead of idling until its next heartbeat.
//
// Two safety properties this module owns (both pure, both tested):
//   * Empty-inbox fast path: an empty inbox produces `None` — no block, no
//     writes. Every leaf session (which has no children, hence an empty inbox)
//     pays nothing on every Stop.
//   * Consecutive-block budget: a parent that keeps blocking itself without a
//     genuine user turn in between could wedge in a loop. The budget caps
//     consecutive Stop-drain blocks (default 3); once exhausted the drain
//     declines to block (returns `None`) so the session can actually stop. A
//     genuine user turn (`UserPromptSubmit`) resets the budget.
