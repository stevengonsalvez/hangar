// ABOUTME: One message to every checked session — the composer, the send, and
// what each recipient's leg actually did.
//
// NOT a `ChatHost`. A thread and Pal are CONVERSATIONS: they have a
// durable scope, a timeline, and a page that reloads it. A broadcast has none
// of those — `fleet/broadcast` fans one text out to N sessions and answers with
// N receipts, and there is nothing to page afterwards. Modelling it as a
// conversation would mean inventing a scope for it, which is exactly the
// "named channel" the Pal tab already offers for operators who want one.
