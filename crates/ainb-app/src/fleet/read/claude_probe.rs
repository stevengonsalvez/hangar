// ABOUTME: Tier-A Claude probe — first-party session state from
// `~/.claude/sessions/<pid>.json`, the highest-quality evidence tier.
//
// Claude Code (verified on 2.1.220 through 2.1.227) writes one probe file per
// live session: `{pid, sessionId, cwd, status, waitingFor, statusUpdatedAt,
// procStart, ...}` with `status` ∈ busy | idle | waiting | shell. It is the
// only source in the fleet that states BUSY affirmatively — every other tier
// can only infer "not needing attention" from absence — and it reports
// `waiting` the instant a session blocks, with no idle-minutes heuristic.
//
// It is also an UNDOCUMENTED internal file, so it is a preferred source and
// never the only one: any gate failure here returns `None`/`Fallback` and the
// session flows to the hook tier and then the pane scan, exactly as today.
//
// Everything that decides is pure: parsing, the liveness gate, and the
// status→[`Resolution`] mapping all take their inputs as data. The only I/O is
// [`load_dir`], a thin directory listing.
