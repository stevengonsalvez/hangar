// ABOUTME: The per-daemon probes + the [`collect`] aggregator the CLI and TUI share.
//
// Each probe turns one daemon's on-disk signals into a typed [`DaemonStatus`].
// Two probe shapes:
//
//   * HEARTBEAT-BACKED (bridge, fleet daemon): read the daemon's
//     `~/.agents-in-a-box/daemons/<name>.json` heartbeat and cross-check it.
//     A heartbeat whose `pid` is dead, or whose `last_heartbeat_at` is older
//     than [`STALE_AFTER_MS`], is reported `Stopped` with a "stale heartbeat"
//     reason — the crashed-daemon-shows-stale guarantee. No heartbeat file at
//     all → `Stopped` (clean: never started this session).
//
//   * NATIVE-SIGNAL (notifyd, ATC): read the signals the daemon already
//     maintains instead of a duplicate heartbeat. notifyd = PID-file liveness
//     + Unix socket present + sqlite DB present. ATC = its existing
//     `heartbeat-state.json` cadence across all provisioned instances.
//
// `STALE_AFTER_MS` is deliberately generous (90s) so a daemon that heartbeats
// every few seconds is never flagged stale by a slow tick, while a truly dead
// daemon (whose pid is also gone) is caught immediately by the pid cross-check
// regardless of the window.
