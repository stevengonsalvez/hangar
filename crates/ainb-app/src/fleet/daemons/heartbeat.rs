// ABOUTME: The daemon heartbeat status file — `~/.agents-in-a-box/daemons/<name>.json`.
//
// A long-running ainb daemon (the phone bridge, the fleet auto-continue watcher)
// rewrites this tiny file on startup and on every heartbeat tick. The Daemons
// observability surface (the `ainb fleet daemons` CLI verb + the TUI screen)
// reads it and cross-checks `pid` liveness so a stale file from a *crashed*
// daemon shows "stopped (stale heartbeat)" rather than a false "running".
//
// The shape is deliberately tiny and stable so it stays cheap to rewrite every
// few seconds and forward-compatible (new fields are added with `#[serde(default)]`):
//
//   {
//     "pid": 12345,
//     "started_at": 1700000000000,        // epoch ms — daemon process start
//     "last_heartbeat_at": 1700000005000, // epoch ms — last refresh of this file
//     "last_activity_at": 1700000004000,  // epoch ms — last real work (relay, scan)
//     "connected": true,                  // channel/peer health (daemon-specific)
//     "channel": "Telegram (@mybot)",     // optional human label for the connection
//     "last_error": "getUpdates timeout", // optional last error string
//     "error_count": 0,                   // monotonic error counter for this run
//     "last_attention_poll_at": 170000004000, // epoch ms of last OK attention poll
//     "last_attention_error": "connect …",    // optional last attention-source error
//     "last_delivery_error": "outbound push…",// optional undelivered proactive push
//     "inbound_expected": 1,                  // chat channels this daemon started
//     "inbound_live": 0,                      // how many are still running
//     "last_inbound_error": "Telegram …"      // why the last one stopped
//   }
//
// The two `attention` fields are the OUTBOUND liveness signal: a bridge that is
// connected to its chat gateway can still be completely unable to reach the
// daemon's attention inbox, in which case it pushes nothing to the phone while
// looking perfectly healthy. Only the worker that actually polls the attention
// source can prove otherwise, so it stamps these fields and `super::probe`
// degrades the row when they say the poll is not happening.
//
// The three `inbound_*` fields are the INBOUND liveness signal, and they exist
// for the mirror-image reason. `connected` is set ONCE per chat channel at its
// handshake and is never reset when that channel's task dies, while the idle
// ticker and the outbound poll both keep `last_heartbeat_at` fresh forever. So a
// bridge whose Telegram/Slack/Discord task has exited kept reporting
// "running + connected": the human could still be pushed asks and had no way to
// answer any of them. Counting the channels that were STARTED against the ones
// still RUNNING is the only thing that can tell those apart, and it is kept
// deliberately separate from the outbound fields so the health reason can name
// WHICH half is broken instead of collapsing both into one verdict.
//
// `last_delivery_error` covers the OTHER half of the same blind spot. Reaching
// the attention source proves only that the bridge can READ the ask; the send to
// Discord/Slack/Telegram can still fail (429, revoked token, DMs disabled) and
// the human hears nothing. That failure is invisible in `last_error` alone
// (`super::probe` never reads it), so it gets its own sticky field, cleared the
// moment a poll finds nothing left undelivered.
//
// Heartbeats that already have a richer signal elsewhere (ATC's
// `heartbeat-state.json`, notifyd's PID file + socket + DB) are READ in
// `super::probe` instead of re-emitted — only daemons with no existing
// observability write this file.
