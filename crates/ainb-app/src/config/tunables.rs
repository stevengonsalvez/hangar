// ABOUTME: The config sections promoted out of env vars and hardcoded literals,
// plus the `env > config > default` resolver every promoted read site uses.

//! Promoted tunables.
//!
//! Before this module a knob was either an env var with a literal fallback
//! (`AINB_HEADROOM_PORT` or 8787) or a bare `const` no user could reach. Both
//! shapes hide the value from `ainb config` and from the settings screen, and
//! the env-var shape repeatedly grew *two* fallbacks for one name. See
//! [`FleetConfig::state_stale_ms`](crate::config::FleetConfig::state_stale_ms).
//!
//! Every knob here now has exactly one coded default, expressed once as a
//! serde default on the field, and one resolution ladder:
//!
//! ```text
//! env var  >  config.toml  >  the field's serde default
//! ```
//!
//! matching the ladder the plugin `[[config]]` mechanism already uses. The env
//! var keeps winning: scripts, CI and `just` recipes set them today and must
//! not start losing to a file.
//!
//! ## Two ways a value reaches a reader
//!
//! A read site **inside `ainb`** resolves in code, via [`resolved`] /
//! [`resolved_bool`] over [`snapshot`].
//!
//! A read site in another crate cannot: `ainb-fleet-core`, `ainb-adapters-tool`
//! and the plugin binaries do not depend on `ainb`, and giving each of them its
//! own config parser would make a fifth parser of one file. Those sites keep
//! reading their env var, and [`export_env_bridge`] publishes the config value
//! into the process environment once at startup, only where the variable is
//! unset, so an operator's `AINB_FLEET_IDLE_MIN=2` still wins. Child processes
//! (plugin subprocesses, the hangar daemon) inherit it for free, which is the
//! same path their config already travels.
