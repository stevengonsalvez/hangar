// ABOUTME: Issue #983's leak checks over the per-section mirror frames. Nothing
// sensitive may reach `wire::section_json`, and the frame shape is locked.
//
// Four independent checks, each over what `section_json` actually emits:
//   1. name deny-list   JSON keys at any depth, case-insensitive, word-aware
//   2. type deny-list   declared Rust type of every field on the wire
//   3. canary           a unique marker in every typed text field of the state
//   4. tripwire         credential-shaped values anywhere in the frames
// plus a fixture of every leaf key path, so a new field fails until triaged.
//
// Each allow-list entry is a field that stays on the wire on purpose, with the
// one-line reason a security reviewer re-checks. An entry that no longer
// matches anything fails too, so the lists cannot go stale.
