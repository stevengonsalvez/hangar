// ABOUTME: Each parity fixture's framed sections, committed beside it, so the
// DOM half of parity renders from what a window actually receives.
//
// The ratatui half builds the fixture into an `AppState` and draws it
// (`ainb-core/tests/parity_snapshots.rs`). A webview never sees an `AppState`:
// it sees frames. So this writes `<fixture>.frames.json`, one entry per
// section, and the node runner renders the same fixture from that file. One
// fixture, two renderers, one set of facts to diff.
//
// The dump is the contract, so a plain run never rewrites it: set
// `UPDATE_PARITY_FRAMES=1` deliberately, read the diff, and commit it.
