// ABOUTME: Every committed parity fixture builds into an AppState that opens
// the screen it names, and every fixture with an expected-facts list shows
// each of those facts in the screen the ratatui half drew.
//
// The renderer half lives in `ainb-core/tests/parity_snapshots.rs`, which
// draws these same fixtures, and the webview half in
// `ainb-desktop/ui/src/parity.test.ts`, which renders them from the committed
// frames. The facts list is ONE file read by both, so a fact only one renderer
// shows is a fact the other is missing, rather than two lists that drift.
