//! SyncPlanner — decide, per unit, which way `ainb skill sync` should
//! reconcile home ↔ repo state (spec §Phase D, bead v12.D.1).
//!
//! [`plan_sync`] is a **pure** function: it performs no I/O and consults
//! no globals, so identical inputs always yield an identical plan. The
//! impure work — hashing the on-disk home/repo files, reading their
//! mtimes, resolving the source repo's HEAD — is the caller's job and
//! arrives pre-computed as [`UnitSnapshot`]s. The [`SyncEngine`] (beads
//! v12.D.2/D.3) then *executes* the returned [`SyncAction`]s; this module
//! only plans.
//!
//! # Decision model
//!
//! For each unit the planner first checks **eligibility**: the unit's
//! repo-relative path must be covered by the source's effective folder
//! layout (the passed `mappings`, or the source's own `target_layout`,
//! falling back to the bootstrap defaults). An uncovered unit can't be
//! placed on either side, so it is a [`NoOp`].
//!
//! Eligible units are decided by **git refs when available**, else by
//! **mtime fallback**:
//!
//! ```text
//!                         ┌── deployed_sha + both content_sha present ──┐
//!   home == repo                         → NoOp   (already in sync)
//!   home != deployed, repo == deployed   → ToRepo (local edit to push)
//!   repo != deployed, home == deployed   → ToHome (upstream change)
//!   home != deployed, repo != deployed   → NoOp   (conflict — manual)
//!                         └── otherwise (no deployed_sha / no sha) ──────┘
//!   home.mtime > repo.mtime              → ToRepo
//!   repo.mtime > home.mtime              → ToHome
//!   equal / indeterminate                → NoOp
//! ```
//!
//! Presence asymmetry short-circuits the above: a unit present on only
//! one side syncs toward the missing side. Finally, a `ToRepo` against a
//! `read_only` source is downgraded to `NoOp` — externally-managed
//! sources never receive writes.
//!
//! [`NoOp`]: SyncDirection::NoOp
