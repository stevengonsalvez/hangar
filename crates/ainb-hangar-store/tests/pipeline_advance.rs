//! [`PullService::advance_after_stage`] contract tests: the HANDOFF that makes a
//! pipeline a pipeline.
//!
//! # Why this file exists
//!
//! The advance had NO automated coverage. It is referenced from exactly one
//! place (`board.rs`'s `advance_pipeline_stage`) and from no test in the
//! workspace, and its only proof was `live_pipeline_walks_four_stages`, which
//! sits behind the `live-e2e` cargo feature. That feature has zero references in
//! `.github/workflows/`, so it never runs in CI, and it cannot: it needs real
//! authenticated provider CLIs. The gate is inherently local, so the invariants
//! are pinned here instead, against a real ephemeral `SQLite` database.
//!
//! What the statement must guarantee:
//!   * it steps EXACTLY ONE column, never jumping to the end of the board,
//!   * it refuses at the last column rather than running off the end,
//!   * it refuses while the card still holds an active task,
//!   * it refuses when either `auto_move` kill-switch is off,
//!   * it refuses on a column that is not role-gated,
//!   * a board deleted mid-run is a clean no-op, not an error.
//!
//! The refusals matter as much as the move: every one of them is a case where
//! the card must stay exactly where it is, and a statement that moved it anyway
//! would strand work or skip a review stage silently.
//!
//! # Every refusal carries a MUTATION PROOF
//!
//! A test that only runs the real statement proves the card STAYED PUT. It
//! cannot prove that the guard under test is what kept it there: delete the
//! guard and the test may well keep passing because another clause happened to
//! refuse the same row. So each refusal is paired with a `mutation_proof_*` test
//! that deletes exactly that guard from [`ADVANCE_SQL`] and asserts the card NOW
//! MOVES. The mutant is the code without that one guard, which is the only way
//! to show these tests are not vacuous, given the guards were already in place
//! when this file was written.
