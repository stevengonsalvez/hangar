//! Typed repository wrapper over the `attention` table (migration 0025) — the
//! control-plane inbox (architecture §4.3, spec P2).
//!
//! [`AttentionRepo`] is a thin, stateless sqlx layer over the durable set of
//! input requests every session on the host raises. The daemon's ingest
//! producer classifies a session and calls [`AttentionRepo::insert_if_absent`]
//! (or [`AttentionRepo::insert`] where no request identity exists); the
//! control-centre surfaces read the open set via [`AttentionRepo::list_open`]
//! (workspace-scoped) or [`AttentionRepo::list_fleet`] (host-wide); the answer
//! router flips a row through [`AttentionRepo::mark_answered_if_open`].
//!
//! **First-answer-wins** is the whole point of the conditional flip:
//! [`AttentionRepo::mark_answered_if_open`] only updates a row that is still
//! `open`, and returns the number of rows it changed. `0` means the row was
//! already answered (or gone) — the second surface to answer the same question
//! loses the race and is told "already answered by X" WITHOUT a second delivery.
//! That is exactly-once answering enforced at the database, not in application
//! code that could race two connections.
