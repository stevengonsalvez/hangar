//! Durable raw provider-event ledger for Fleet projections, and (since 0079)
//! the ACP transcript store.
//!
//! ## RETENTION: three regimes, split by `source` and by projection state.
//!
//! **Projection sources (`source <> 'acp'`), ALREADY REDUCED
//! (`projection_revision IS NOT NULL`): payload evicted after 7 days**, by the
//! automatic sweep in `ainb-hangar-daemon`'s `fleet_provider_retention`, which
//! calls [`FleetProviderEventRepo::evict_projected_payloads_before`].
//!
//! This REVERSES the never-trim stance this header carried from 0071 until
//! 0094, and the reversal is measurement-driven. That stance rested on a growth
//! model of "roughly 21 rows per 2 days at a ~344 byte mean payload, ~1.3 MB
//! per YEAR", which is falsified: measured on a real profile the table is
//! **372,031 rows / 2,207 MB**, a ~5.9 KB mean payload and three orders of
//! magnitude more bytes than the model allowed for. At that size the table
//! saturated the single `SQLite` writer this crate shares with the Fleet
//! reducer and the ACP transcript writer, and session spawn began failing with
//! `database is locked` — so the cost of keeping every envelope forever is no
//! longer hypothetical disk, it is an unusable daemon.
//!
//! What the old stance was protecting is preserved anyway: a FUTURE reducer can
//! still replay HISTORY, because eviction deletes no row. `ingest_order`,
//! `event_id`, `raw_blake3` and `projection_revision` all survive an eviction —
//! only the bytes of `raw_payload` go, and only on rows a reducer has already
//! consumed. What is genuinely given up is re-deriving NEW facts from an
//! envelope older than 7 days; that is the trade the measurement forces, and
//! 7 days is where it was struck (~450 MB of the measured corpus retained).
//!
//! One accepted consequence, visible rather than silent:
//!
//! 1. [`Self::list_by_session_after`] pages by `session_key` alone, so a
//!    transcript read of a non-ACP session older than the TTL returns rows
//!    whose payload is `""`. That is the retention policy being visible, not a
//!    fault: the row, its order and its type still render, and
//!    `transcript_chunk_wire` already carries a non-JSON payload through as a
//!    string rather than failing the read.
//!
//! **Projection sources, NOT YET REDUCED (`projection_revision IS NULL`):
//! never touched by anything.** On these rows NULL marks pending recovery work
//! which the Codex manager replays on startup, not garbage. Blanking such a
//! payload destroys the replay input itself, so both the sweep predicate and
//! [`Self::delete_acp_before`]'s `source` filter exclude them, and nothing may
//! ever delete such a row.
//!
//! **ACP transcript rows (`source = 'acp'`): operator-invoked
//! export-then-delete only, via [`FleetProviderEventRepo::delete_acp_before`].**
//! These rows carry NO `projection_revision` recovery contract (no reducer
//! ever projects them; `NULL` is their steady state, not pending work), which
//! is exactly what makes deleting them safe. They dominate write volume — one
//! ACP turn emits tens to low hundreds of coalesced chunk rows, so five
//! sessions at twenty turns a day at fifty rows a turn is ~5,000 rows and
//! roughly 1.8 MB per DAY — and they are deliberately left OUT of the automatic
//! sweep, because their reclaim path exports before it destroys and only an
//! operator can say where that export goes.
//!
//! Revisit trigger: `source='acp'` rows exceeding ~1M rows or ~100 MB on a
//! real profile without the export-then-delete command having been run, or ACP
//! write volume visibly contending the single `SQLite` writer (watch the
//! commits-issued counter).
//!
//! Revisit trigger for the PROJECTION-source regime, which the 7-day sweep now
//! bounds: live `raw_payload` for `source <> 'acp'` exceeding ~500 MB on a real
//! profile, or the measured accrual rate exceeding ~150 MB/day (it was ~64
//! MB/day when the sweep was written, and the 7-day window holds roughly seven
//! times the daily rate).
//!
//! This trigger exists because its absence is what let the previous model rot.
//! From 0071 to 0094 this header asserted ~1.3 MB per YEAR from a ~344 byte
//! mean, with nothing to check it against; the real figures were 372k rows /
//! 2207 MB at a ~5.9 KB mean, and the gap only surfaced when the writer
//! saturated and session spawn began failing. An age cutoff alone fixes the
//! WINDOW and lets the arrival rate pick the size, so a rate that doubles
//! doubles the residue with no other signal — the same argument
//! [`crate::repo::fleet_retention`] makes for keeping a byte ceiling as a
//! co-equal control on `fleet_event`. No ceiling is implemented here yet; this
//! trigger is the manual stand-in for one, and reaching it means writing it.
//!
//! The pending-recovery partial index keeps its predicate
//! (`WHERE projection_revision IS NULL`) across 0079; ACP rows are pushed out
//! of the recovery scan's way by the index KEY
//! (`source, provider, projection_revision`), never by a predicate the
//! planner could not prove for a bound `source = ?` parameter.
//!
//! 0094's retention index CAN carry `source <> 'acp'` in its predicate, and
//! that is not a contradiction: the sweep spells all three of its terms as
//! LITERALS, so the implication is provable at plan time, whereas the recovery
//! scan binds `source = ?` and nothing about a parameter is provable.
