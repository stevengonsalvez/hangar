//! ACP session identity: the ACP-specific adjunct to `fleet_session`.
//!
//! `session_key` is daemon-minted and STABLE (`acp:<ulid>`); `acp_session_id`
//! is the adapter's MUTABLE id, swapped whenever the resume routine rebuilds
//! the adapter-side session. Receipts, scopes, and `fleet/action` all key on
//! `session_key`, so a rebuild never disturbs them.
//!
//! At most ONE live (`ACTIVE` or `IDLE`) session exists per scope, enforced by
//! the partial unique index `idx_fleet_acp_session_scope_active`; a
//! conflicting insert returns the existing live row, which is what makes
//! `fleet/acp_session_create` idempotent per live scope.
//!
//! `provider` is an adapter token validated against the adapter registry at
//! the RPC layer, NOT the schema (the 0071 `source` style), so the next
//! adapter needs no migration.
