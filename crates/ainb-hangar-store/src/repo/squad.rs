//! Typed repository wrapper over the `squad` × `squad_member` tables (e38.17).
//!
//! A [`Squad`] is a workspace-scoped group of actors with a designated LEADER
//! ([`migration 0017`](../../migrations/0017_squad.sql)). It is the first
//! construct that lets work be assigned to a *team* rather than a single actor.
//! This repo is the only mutation + read surface over the two tables: create a
//! squad with a leader, add / remove member actors, list squads (with their
//! members), and — crucially — resolve a squad to its LEADER's agent id, which is
//! how leader-routing actually takes effect.
//!
//! # Leader routing
//!
//! A squad does NOT introduce a new [`ActorKind`](ainb_hangar_core::actor::ActorKind).
//! Routing rides the squad's leader actor-ref: the existing `agent_task_queue` is
//! `agent_id`-keyed and claimed per-runtime, so a task enqueued for a squad
//! carries the LEADER's `agent_id` and the existing claim/dispatch path routes it
//! to the leader agent with no claim-path change.
//! [`leader_agent_id`](SquadRepo::leader_agent_id) is the seam: it resolves a
//! squad to its leader's agent id (`Some` when the leader is an `agent`, `None`
//! when the leader is a human `member` — a human leader carries no agent to
//! dispatch to), so the daemon / CLI can build a `NewTask` that the leader claims.
//!
//! # Workspace scoping
//!
//! **Every method takes a [`WorkspaceId`] and enforces it in SQL.** A squad id /
//! name from another tenant resolves to no row (a
//! [`SquadRepoError::NotFound`], never a cross-tenant edit), and listing a foreign
//! / unknown workspace yields an empty vec. The `(workspace_id, name)` UNIQUE
//! index is the resolve-or-reject guard: creating a second squad with a name that
//! already exists in the workspace is rejected with [`SquadRepoError::DuplicateName`].
//!
//! The `(workspace_id, name)` UNIQUE index, the `(squad_id, member_type,
//! member_id)` composite PK, the two `leader_type`/`member_type` CHECKs, and the
//! `squad_id` FK are the engine-enforced invariants (foreign keys ARE on — sqlx
//! enables `PRAGMA foreign_keys` by default). The actor-ref `_id` halves carry no
//! FK by design (they are polymorphic), and an FK could not express tenant scope
//! anyway, so the workspace-scope guard and the leader-resolution are enforced
//! here in application code.
