//! The mutation ledger (migration 0097), one durable row per operation, so a
//! retry is a READ (spec D18, critique amendments 15-19).
//!
//! The failure this table exists for is a LOST REPLY. The daemon committed, the
//! socket died, the client retried; without a ledger the second attempt is a
//! second execution, and for a mutation that types into a terminal that is a
//! second `yes` on an agent about to run a command.
//!
//! ```text
//! claim(host, principal, op_id)
//!   ├─ inserted        ──▶ Fresh          run the handler, then record_reply
//!   ├─ row, reply set  ──▶ Replay         return the stored reply verbatim
//!   ├─ row, in flight  ──▶ InFlight       another attempt owns it
//!   ├─ row, other body ──▶ BodyMismatch   different answer, same op id
//!   ├─ row, expired    ──▶ Expired        aged out; the effect is unknowable
//!   └─ row, other principal ──▶ Foreign   somebody else's op id
//! ```
//!
//! Every entry point exists twice: once taking a pool, once taking a
//! caller-owned transaction. The transaction form is not a convenience, it is
//! the whole tier-2 guarantee. A receipt written through the event outbox would
//! inherit that outbox's documented crash loss window, so the receipt has to be
//! in the SAME transaction as the state flip it describes.
