//! Channels, guardrail confirm cards and the Pal activity feed
//! (migration 0083, buzz-port part 2).
//!
//! Three small tables under one roof because they are one concern: what the
//! Pal channel is, what it asked a human for, and what it did.
//!
//! Two rules carry across from the chat bus and are the reason this module
//! exists rather than raw queries at the call sites:
//!
//! * **`seq` is the cursor, `id` is the identity.** `fleet_activity` pages by
//!   the commit-ordered `seq` `SQLite` assigns inside the write transaction,
//!   never by a ULID and never by a wall clock.
//! * **A confirm card is single-use.** Every terminal write is guarded by
//!   `WHERE state = 'open'`, so exactly one of (answer, second answer, expiry)
//!   wins and the losers see zero rows affected. That is what makes "answering
//!   an already-answered card is a typed error, never a second execution" a
//!   property of the store instead of a race at the RPC layer.
