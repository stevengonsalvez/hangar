//! Typed repository over the `dispatch_attempt` audit table (multica parity #12,
//! migration 0058).
//!
//! One row per **admission decision**: a trigger surface tried to turn a card
//! into a run, and this is the stable code
//! ([`ainb_hangar_core::dispatch_reason::DispatchReason`]) plus the free-text
//! detail for what happened. It is the persistent answer to "why is my card not
//! running", which before 0058 existed only as an ephemeral RPC error string or
//! a debug log line.
//!
//! # Newest-first is ordered by `rowid`, not by `id`
//!
//! `created_at` is epoch MILLISECONDS, and a burst of admission decisions for
//! one card lands inside a single millisecond routinely. The tie-break must
//! therefore carry the real insertion order. `id` cannot: it is a ULID, whose
//! low 80 bits are random within a millisecond, so `ORDER BY created_at DESC,
//! id DESC` scrambled same-millisecond rows and made "newest first" a lie —
//! both for the trim (which decides what to KEEP) and for every reader.
//! SQLite's implicit `rowid` is monotonic per insert and the table is not
//! `WITHOUT ROWID`, so it is the tie-break with no schema change.
//!
//! # Bounded by construction
//!
//! [`DispatchAttemptRepo::record`] trims the issue's history to the newest
//! [`DISPATCH_ATTEMPT_KEEP`] rows in the same call as the insert, so a hot
//! auto-run cascade cannot grow the table without bound and no sweeper job is
//! needed (see the migration's comment block).
//!
//! # Workspace scoping
//!
//! [`DispatchAttemptRepo::list_by_workspace`] is `workspace_id`-scoped like every
//! other repo here, so a sibling tenant's attempts are never returned.
//! [`DispatchAttemptRepo::latest_for_issue`] / [`DispatchAttemptRepo::list_for_issue`]
//! key on the issue id, which is already tenant-resolved by every caller.
//!
//! # Lenient reads
//!
//! [`DispatchAttempt::reason`] is kept as the raw `String` and decoded on demand
//! via [`DispatchAttempt::code`]: a token written by a newer daemon that this
//! binary does not know decodes to `None` and is rendered as raw text rather
//! than failing the read.
