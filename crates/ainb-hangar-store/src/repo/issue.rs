//! Typed repository wrapper over the `issue` table.
//!
//! [`IssueRepo`] is a thin, stateless sqlx wrapper. The notable feature is the
//! **polymorphic actor** mapping: an issue's assignee and creator are
//! [`ActorRef`]s in the Rust API, but at the SQL boundary each is split into the
//! two TEXT columns the schema actually stores (`assignee_type`/`assignee_id`,
//! `creator_type`/`creator_id`).
//!
//! # `(actor_type, actor_id)` invariant
//!
//! There is deliberately **no foreign key** on the `_id` columns — an actor may
//! live in either the `member` or `agent` table, which a single `SQLite` FK cannot
//! express. This is FK-less by design (per the reference architecture review §7).
//! The `_type` columns' `CHECK` constraints keep the discriminant honest; the
//! [`ActorRef`] type keeps the `_id` half non-empty; referential integrity of
//! the `_id` value is a service-layer concern.
