//! Typed repository over the `card_dependency` edge table (tcp T4 / F7).
//!
//! A card dependency is a directed edge `dependent -> blocker`: the DEPENDENT
//! card is blocked until the BLOCKER card finishes. Card = issue (§4.5), so both
//! endpoints are `issue.id`s in one workspace. This repo is the only mutation +
//! read surface over the table:
//!
//!   - [`CardDependencyRepo::add_edge`] — insert one edge, rejecting a self-edge
//!     and any edge that would create a CYCLE (a DFS over the existing edges runs
//!     BEFORE the write, so the graph is acyclic by construction);
//!   - [`CardDependencyRepo::remove_edge`] — idempotent delete of one edge;
//!   - [`CardDependencyRepo::blockers_of`] / [`CardDependencyRepo::dependents_of`]
//!     — the forward / reverse adjacency;
//!   - [`CardDependencyRepo::unfinished_blockers_of`] — the refuse-run guard: the
//!     dependent's blockers that have not FINISHED (their active set drained with a
//!     `done`; a card with any unfinished blocker refuses to run and is never
//!     auto-dispatched);
//!   - [`CardDependencyRepo::links_of_workspace`] — every typed link in the
//!     workspace, for the board snapshot's 🔒 blocked-state render;
//!   - [`CardDependencyRepo::set_auto_run`] / [`CardDependencyRepo::get_auto_run`]
//!     — the per-card auto-run flag (default OFF) the finalize seam consults when
//!     the last blocker completes.
//!
//! # Workspace scoping
//!
//! Every mutation takes a [`WorkspaceId`] and resolves BOTH endpoints inside it
//! before writing (the schema declares no FK on either issue id, and an FK would
//! prove only existence, never the tenant — see migration 0036),
//! so a dependency can never reference a foreign-tenant / nonexistent issue or
//! cross a workspace boundary. The composite PK `(dependent, blocker)` is the sole
//! engine-enforced invariant; existence, scoping, and acyclicity are enforced
//! here in application code (mirroring `BoardRepo`).
//!
//! # "Finished" = the latest generation's active set drained, with a success
//!
//! A blocker is FINISHED when EVERY task in its LATEST run generation (migration
//! 0039) is terminal (that run's active set has drained) AND at least one of them
//! reached `done`. A squad blocker fans out N tasks onto one issue (all sharing one
//! generation), so keying on the whole generation — not just the latest task — is
//! what stops a dependent unblocking while the leader / other members still run
//! (tcp T4 / FANOUT-SEMANTICS). Scoping to the LATEST generation is what re-blocks a
//! blocker that succeeded once then was re-run and failed (tcp 8ln). A blocker with
//! no task, with any still-active task in its latest generation, or whose latest
//! generation ended `failed`/`cancelled` (no `done`) is UNFINISHED, so the dependent
//! stays blocked. See [`CardDependencyRepo::unfinished_blockers_of`].
//!
//! # Typed links (multica parity #20, migration 0055)
//!
//! Every row carries a [`LinkKind`]. At rest the domain is
//! `{'blocked_by', 'related'}`: `blocks` is the SAME edge read from the other end
//! and is normalised at write into a swapped `blocked_by` row, so one logical
//! relation can never be stored two ways. `related` is symmetric, exempt from the
//! cycle guard, and INVISIBLE to every gating read
//! ([`CardDependencyRepo::blockers_of`], [`CardDependencyRepo::dependents_of`],
//! [`CardDependencyRepo::unfinished_blockers_of`], the cycle DFS) — so a related
//! card can neither refuse a run nor be auto-launched by the finalize seam.
