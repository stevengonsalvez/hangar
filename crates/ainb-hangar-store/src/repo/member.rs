//! Typed repository wrapper over the `member` × `user` tables (e38.11).
//!
//! A [`Member`] is a `(workspace_id, user_id)` row carrying a `role` of `owner`,
//! `admin`, or `member` (migration 0001's `CHECK` constraint). The `member` table
//! has been data-only since v1 — seeded once as the workspace owner — so this repo
//! is the first *mutation* surface over it: list, set-role, and remove, each
//! workspace-scoped and each guarding the workspace's last owner.
//!
//! # Workspace scoping
//!
//! **Every method takes a [`WorkspaceId`] and enforces it in SQL.** The `member`
//! PK is `(workspace_id, user_id)`, so a `(workspace, user)` pair from another
//! tenant resolves to no row and a mutation aimed at it touches nothing (a
//! [`MemberRepoError::NotFound`], never a cross-tenant edit). Listing a foreign /
//! unknown workspace yields an empty vec, never another tenant's members.
//!
//! # The last-owner invariant
//!
//! A workspace must always keep at least one `owner` (otherwise nobody can
//! administer it). Both [`set_role`](MemberRepo::set_role) and
//! [`remove`](MemberRepo::remove) refuse the mutation when it would drop the
//! workspace's owner count to zero — demoting the sole owner, or removing it,
//! is rejected with [`MemberRepoError::LastOwner`]. The check counts owners
//! INSIDE the mutation's transaction (so a concurrent demotion cannot race past
//! it) and only blocks when the *target* is currently an owner and is the *only*
//! one; demoting one of two owners is allowed.
//!
//! The `(workspace_id, user_id)` composite PK and the `role` `CHECK` are the
//! engine-enforced invariants (as are the declared FKs — sqlx enables `PRAGMA
//! foreign_keys` by default). The role-token validation and the last-owner guard
//! are semantic rules no constraint can express, so they are enforced here in
//! application code.
