//! Retention primitives for the `fleet_event` ledger.
//!
//! `fleet_event` is the Fleet revision log. Until migration 0080 it had NO
//! retention at all: measured on a real profile it reached 1.1M rows / 847 MB,
//! of which 724 MB was hook payloads over 87k rows. The corpus is RATE-driven
//! rather than age-driven — 713 of those 714 MB were under seven days old, at
//! roughly 102 MB/day — so an age cutoff generous enough to feel safe would
//! have held the problem steady instead of solving it.
//!
//! Two independent reclaim mechanisms, plus a byte ceiling that tightens the
//! first one:
//!
//! 1. **Payload eviction** ([`FleetRetentionRepo::evict_payloads_before`]).
//!    Blanks the BODY of aged hook events and stamps `payload_evicted_at`. The
//!    row, its revision, and its ordering survive untouched, so no cursor moves.
//! 2. **Row delete** ([`FleetRetentionRepo::delete_events_before`]). Removes
//!    whole rows at a much longer horizon, guarded so it can never destroy the
//!    event backing a session's current request.
//!
//! ## Why deleting rows is safe for replay cursors
//!
//! Not re-derived here: `migrations/0075_prune_tmux_flipflop.sql` documents it
//! in full. In short — `revision` is `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT`, so a
//! deleted revision is never reused; every replay path is a `revision > ?`
//! range scan that simply skips holes; and state is served by the snapshot, not
//! rebuilt from replay. [`Self::delete_events_before`] additionally refuses to
//! touch the ledger HEAD, so no subscriber can be left parked past the end.
