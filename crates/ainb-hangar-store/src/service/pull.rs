//! The `PullCard` service: role-gated, one-owner-per-card PULL of board work.
//!
//! This is the seam that replaces BROADCAST with PULL. Before it,
//! [`SquadAssignService::assign_fanout`](crate::service::squad_assign::SquadAssignService::assign_fanout)
//! wrote one `agent_task_queue` row per squad member, so one issue became N
//! simultaneous runs all doing the same work in N worktrees. After it, a card
//! sitting in a role-gated column IS the queue, and exactly one eligible agent
//! takes it.
//!
//! # Why the queue row is created HERE and not by a dispatcher
//!
//! `agent_task_queue.agent_id` is `NOT NULL`, so a queued row always already
//! names its agent: the pre-existing model is PUSH (a dispatcher picks the
//! agent; [`ClaimTaskService`](crate::service::claim::ClaimTaskService) merely
//! executes that choice). True pull needs the agent chosen AT CLAIM TIME.
//! Rather than make `agent_id` nullable (a full table rebuild on SQLite, against
//! a populated production database), the `board_card` row is the queue and this
//! service INSERTs the `agent_task_queue` row once an eligible agent has been
//! selected. The agent is therefore known by construction at insert time.
//!
//! The result is a two-stage pipeline that reuses the whole existing claim path
//! unchanged:
//!
//! ```text
//! board_card in a role-gated column        <- the pull queue
//!        |  PullService::pull_for_runtime  (this module: role / WIP / reviewer
//!        v                                  / blocked / capacity predicates)
//! agent_task_queue row, status 'queued'    <- the execution queue
//!        |  ClaimTaskService::claim_for_runtime  (unchanged)
//!        v
//! status 'dispatched' -> the runner
//! ```
//!
//! # Atomicity
//!
//! The whole selection-and-insert is ONE `INSERT ... SELECT ... RETURNING`
//! statement, for the same reason
//! [`CLAIM_SQL`](crate::service::claim) is one statement: SQLite serialises
//! writes, so a concurrent puller's sub-select observes this statement's
//! committed row and its one-owner-per-card guard then excludes the card. Two
//! agents can therefore never take the same card, and the guarantee holds across
//! processes, not just across tasks in one daemon.
//!
//! # The six predicates
//!
//! A `(card, agent)` pair is *pullable* when ALL of these hold:
//!
//! 1. **Role gate.** The card's column declares a `services_role` and the agent
//!    HOLDS that role. A column with `services_role IS NULL` (Backlog, Done, and
//!    every column that predates migration 0074) is not a pull queue at all, so
//!    work parks there until a human or the auto-advance moves it.
//! 2. **WIP limit.** The column currently has fewer than `wip_limit` cards
//!    holding an active task. `NULL` means unlimited.
//! 3. **One owner per card.** The card's issue has NO active
//!    (`queued`/`dispatched`/`running`) task at all. This is strictly stronger
//!    than the pre-existing per-(issue, agent) guard, and it is what makes
//!    "exactly one task running per card" true rather than merely likely.
//! 4. **The stage is not already finished.** The card's CURRENT column holds no
//!    `done` task at the card's CURRENT generation. This is the FINALIZE WINDOW
//!    guard: `done` commits in the claim loop's finalize, four awaited
//!    best-effort steps run, and only then does the advance move the card, so a
//!    concurrent pull tick sees a terminal stage on an unmoved card and every
//!    other predicate passes (predicate 3 reads the ACTIVE set, and a `done`
//!    task is not in it). Without this the same implementer re-pulls the card it
//!    just finished, and a different reviewer double-reviews. `board_column_id`
//!    (migration 0078) is what makes the question answerable; see that file for
//!    why the generation alone is not enough. Scoping to the current generation
//!    is what keeps a RE-ENQUEUED card, moved back to an earlier stage for
//!    another pass, pullable rather than frozen by its own history.
//! 5. **Prior-agent exclusion.** On a column with `excludes_prior_agent = 1`, an
//!    agent that already holds a `done` task on this card may not take it. This
//!    is the reviewer-is-never-the-implementer rule. Note the direction of
//!    failure: if the only eligible agent implemented the card, the card WAITS
//!    rather than being self-reviewed.
//! 6. **Not blocked, and the agent has capacity.** Unfinished `card_dependency`
//!    blockers make a card unpullable at every stage (the F7 refuse-run guard,
//!    reused verbatim from
//!    [`CardDependencyRepo::unfinished_blockers_of`](crate::repo::card_dependency::CardDependencyRepo::unfinished_blockers_of)),
//!    and the agent must be under its `max_concurrent_tasks` cap.
//!
//! # How an agent's ROLES resolve
//!
//! Via `squad_member.role` (migration 0053), which until now had no consumer at
//! the dispatch seam: `SquadRepo::member_agent_ids` is documented "role-blind by
//! design", which is precisely the broadcast defect. An agent HOLDS a role when
//! any of its squad memberships, in the same workspace, names that role. No
//! agent-level roles field is introduced, so the existing
//! `SquadRepo::add_member_with_role` / `set_member_role` writers are already the
//! way an operator grants one.
//!
//! A membership's `role` is free text and is matched as a COMMA-SEPARATED TOKEN
//! set, case-insensitively and ignoring spaces, so one membership can advertise
//! several roles (`"implementer,reviewer"`) without a second table. Matching
//! uses `INSTR` over comma-delimited needles rather than `LIKE`, so a role
//! containing `%` or `_` cannot act as a wildcard and silently over-match.

///
/// `agent_kind` is derived from the PULLING AGENT, not from the card. Under pull
/// the agent is chosen per stage, so the provider CLI that runs the stage must be
/// the chosen agent's own: a codex reviewer has to invoke `codex`, even when the
/// card was created with `agent_kind = 'claude'`.
///
/// `agent.provider` is the authority, NOT `agent_runtime.provider`. A runtime is
/// a DAEMON, not a provider binding: `ainb hangar agent create --provider codex`
/// records `codex` on the agent and still binds it to the single `default`
/// runtime, whose own `provider` column reads `claude` for every install. Keying
/// on the runtime therefore silently ran every agent as claude. The runtime is
/// kept only as a fallback for an agent row with no provider recorded, then the
/// card's own kind, then `claude`, so an unrecognised value still dispatches
/// rather than tripping the NOT NULL.
///
/// `generation` is `MAX(existing) + 1`: each STAGE is its own run generation, so
/// the card-state folds (aggregate, blocker-finished, auto-move) that scope to an
/// issue's latest generation see the current stage alone and are not confused by
/// the previous stage's `done` row.
///
/// `parent_task_id` chains each stage to the one before it: the most recent
/// `done` task on the card. This is the HANDOFF CHAIN, and it is what lets an
/// operator (or an assertion) walk a card's history stage by stage and see who
/// handed what to whom. The column already existed for infra retries, whose
/// chain is parent-to-child within one stage; a pipeline chain is the same edge
/// read across stages, so nothing new is introduced. The first stage of a card
/// has no `done` predecessor and correctly chains to NULL.
///
/// The closed-issue guard names `done` FIRST because that is the token the
/// codebase actually writes: `IssueLifecycle::as_str` produces `done`, and
/// migration 0023 rewrote the stored legacy values forward. `closed` is kept
/// only for the beads-sync reconciler, which still writes it. Listing `closed`
/// alone made the guard inert for every hangar-native issue.
///
/// This guard is only safe because the lifecycle no longer promotes an issue to
/// `done` when its FIRST stage lands: `advance_issue_lifecycle_after_terminal`
/// holds the issue at `in_progress` until the card reaches the terminal column of
/// its pipeline. Without that half, adding `done` here would freeze every
/// pipeline after its first stage.
///
/// `board_column_id` (migration 0078) records WHICH STAGE the run serves. Only
/// the pull writes it; every push-path task leaves it NULL. It exists so the
/// finished-stage predicate can distinguish "this stage is done and the card has
/// not advanced yet" (the finalize window, must not re-pull) from "the card DID
/// advance and the next stage is waiting" (must pull). Read from
/// `agent_task_queue` alone those two states are identical.
///
/// # Why this is `pub`
///
/// So the MUTATION PROOFS in `tests/pull_role_gate.rs` can delete exactly one
/// predicate from it and assert the corresponding invariant goes red. A test
/// that only ever runs the real statement proves the invariant holds; it cannot
/// prove the CLAUSE is what makes it hold, and would keep passing if the clause
/// were deleted and some other accident covered for it. Reading the statement
/// under test is the only way to write that proof, so it is deliberately
/// reachable rather than private.
