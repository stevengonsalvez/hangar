//! The `SquadAssign` service: turn a squad assignment into a routed task (e38.17).
//!
//! This is the product seam that makes **leader routing actually take effect**.
//! [`SquadRepo::leader_agent_id`](crate::repo::squad::SquadRepo::leader_agent_id)
//! resolves a squad to its leader's agent id, but a resolver alone routes
//! nothing — something has to convert a squad assignment into a concrete
//! `agent_task_queue` row the existing claim/dispatch path picks up.
//! [`SquadAssignService::assign_to_leader`] is that something: given a squad, it
//!
//! 1. resolves the squad's LEADER to its agent id (the routing seam), rejecting a
//!    human-member leader (no agent to dispatch to) and an unknown squad;
//! 2. looks the leader agent up to derive its **runtime** — the runtime the
//!    leader is bound to, NOT a caller-supplied string — so the claim path keys
//!    the task to the leader's runtime;
//! 3. enqueues a [`NewTask`] carrying the leader's `agent_id` + the leader's
//!    `runtime_id`, so [`ClaimTaskService::claim_for_runtime`] routes the task to
//!    the leader and nobody else.
//!
//! The runtime is **derived from the squad's leader**, not passed in: a caller
//! names the squad (and optionally the issue), and the service alone turns that
//! into the `(agent_id, runtime_id)` pair the queue is keyed on. That is what
//! distinguishes a real routing path from a test that hand-builds the task.
