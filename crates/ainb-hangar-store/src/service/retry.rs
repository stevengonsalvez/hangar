//! The retry service: spawn a child task row when a failed task is eligible.
//!
//! When a task lands in `failed` the daemon asks
//! [`RetryService::maybe_retry_failed`] whether the failure warrants another
//! attempt. A *retryable* failure (the runtime went away, not the agent) with
//! attempts remaining spawns a fresh `queued` child row whose `parent_task_id`
//! chains back to the failed task and whose `attempt` is `parent.attempt + 1`.
//! Everything else (workspace / runtime / agent / issue / work_dir / priority /
//! max_attempts / **repo_ref / agent_kind / squad_id**) is inherited verbatim so
//! the retry re-provisions the SAME repo's worktree under the SAME provider (tcp
//! 19n) and stays keyed to the SAME dispatching squad (migration 0045); all
//! per-run timestamps, outputs, and the recorded `branch` reset.
//!
//! # Retry/resume taxonomy (reference migration 055 + `GetLastTaskSession`)
//!
//! The terminal [`FailureReason`] classifies into one of three
//! [`RetryDisposition`]s ([`RetryService::retry_disposition`]):
//!
//! - **[`RetryDisposition::ResumeRetry`]** —
//!   [`FailureReason::RuntimeOffline`] / [`FailureReason::RuntimeRecovery`]: the
//!   *infrastructure* failed, not the agent, so the retry **resumes** the
//!   parent's provider session (`session_id` is carried onto the child).
//! - **[`RetryDisposition::FreshRetry`]** — the conversation-poisoning terminals
//!   [`FailureReason::IterationLimit`] / [`FailureReason::ApiInvalidRequest`] /
//!   [`FailureReason::SemanticInactivity`]: the model wedged on its own context,
//!   so the retry **starts fresh** — the child's `session_id` is cleared so a
//!   *new* session begins instead of resuming the wedged one. This mirrors
//!   the reference's `GetLastTaskSession`, which excludes poisoned terminal states
//!   from the resume hint so an auto-retry never inherits a stuck conversation.
//! - **[`RetryDisposition::NoRetry`]** — [`FailureReason::AgentError`] (the LLM
//!   mis-tooled / gave up), [`FailureReason::UserCancel`] (terminal by intent),
//!   [`FailureReason::SpawnError`] (provider binary missing / unspawnable), and
//!   [`FailureReason::Timeout`] / [`FailureReason::Unknown`]: no child row.
//!
//! `attempt >= max_attempts` caps the chain regardless of disposition.
//!
//! The child is written in a **single** `INSERT` that sets `status='queued'`
//! alongside `attempt`, `max_attempts`, and `parent_task_id` — mirroring the
//! all-or-nothing discipline of [`ClaimTaskService`](super::claim) so the child
//! row is *correct-or-absent*: there is no two-statement window in which an
//! orphan exists with the schema defaults (`attempt=1`, `parent_task_id=NULL`),
//! which would silently reset the chain cap and break parent-linkage if the
//! process died mid-retry. That single insert is subject to the
//! `idx_one_pending_task_per_issue_agent` partial unique index (migration 0012):
//! if another pending task already holds the per-(issue, agent) slot, the insert
//! raises a UNIQUE error which this service propagates (the reference raises + logs;
//! we mirror that rather than silently swallowing the collision).
