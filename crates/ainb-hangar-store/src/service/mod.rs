//! Task-FSM services.
//!
//! Clock-aware operations that transition `agent_task_queue` rows through their
//! lifecycle.
//!
//! Unlike the [`crate::repo`] wrappers (stateless read + enqueue primitives),
//! services own the *transition* semantics the P1 daemon drives — claiming,
//! starting, completing, failing, and cancelling tasks — and take a
//! [`HangarClock`](ainb_hangar_core::clock::HangarClock) so their timestamps are
//! deterministic under test.
//!
//! P1.2 introduces [`claim`]; P1.3 adds the four finalize services
//! ([`start`], [`complete`], [`fail`], [`cancel`]) over the shared
//! [`finalize`] idempotent-transition primitive; P1.5 adds [`retry`], which
//! spawns a `parent_task_id`-chained child row when a failed task is eligible.

/// The issue-ACTIVITY diff engine (multica parity #13): one `activity_log` row
/// per changed field, shared by the daemon and CLI issue-update writers so the
/// two cannot drift on what counts as a change.
