//! Child-done → parent cascade (migration 0046, multica parity).
//!
//! The **sqlite side** of the sub-issue cascade, called by BOTH the daemon (TUI
//! writes) and the CLI (`ainb hangar issue update`). Mirrors multica's
//! `issue_child_done.go`: when a sub-issue transitions non-terminal → terminal
//! AND that completion CLOSES its stage barrier, a system-style comment is posted
//! on the parent recording the finished child and the roll-up progress.
//!
//! What lives here vs. the daemon:
//! - **Here (store):** the transition + barrier guards, and the comment write —
//!   everything callable without a running daemon, so the CLI and the daemon share
//!   one implementation and the behaviour is unit-testable in-memory.
//! - **Daemon only:** waking the parent's assignee agent (`run_card`), because
//!   only the daemon owns the launch machinery. This service returns a
//!   [`ParentCascade`] describing WHO to wake; the daemon acts on it.
//!
//! # Why the comment is authored by a real actor, not `type='system'`
//!
//! The `comment` table's `author_type` CHECK is `member|agent` only (migration
//! 0003); adding a `system` author would need a full table rebuild (SQLite can't
//! `ALTER` a CHECK). We avoid that: the cascade comment is authored by the child's
//! completing actor (its `assignee` if set, else its `creator` — both guaranteed
//! `member|agent`) and identified by a distinctive body string, so no comment
//! schema change is needed.
