//! ```
//!
//! Backlog and Done carry NO `services_role`, so they are not pull queues: work
//! parks there and is moved by a human or by the stage advance. The four middle
//! stages are role-gated, and a card walks them one column at a time, one owner
//! per stage.
//!
//! # Why every column here has `fsm_state = NULL`
//!
//! This is the load-bearing subtlety, and getting it wrong silently destroys the
//! pipeline.
//!
//! Hangar already has a state-driven auto-move hook,
//! [`BoardRepo::auto_move_on_state`](crate::repo::board::BoardRepo::auto_move_on_state),
//! which the daemon calls on EVERY task FSM transition and which moves a card to
//! the column whose `fsm_state` equals the new task state. That hook and the
//! stage advance are two different concepts sharing one board:
//!
//!   * `auto_move_on_state` is STATE driven: "a task started, show the card under
//!     In Progress". It can only express as many stages as there are task states.
//!   * [`PullService::advance_after_stage`](crate::service::pull::PullService::advance_after_stage)
//!     is SEQUENCE driven: "this stage finished, step one column right".
//!
//! If a pipeline column carried `fsm_state = 'done'` the state hook would fire
//! the moment the FIRST stage completed and jump the card straight to that
//! column, skipping Review and QA entirely. The pipeline would appear to work
//! and would in fact never review anything.
//!
//! Leaving `fsm_state` NULL makes the state hook INERT on these columns (its
//! query matches on `col.fsm_state = new_state`, and NULL never equals anything)
//! while `auto_move = 1` keeps the operator's existing per-column and
//! per-board kill-switch meaningful, because that is exactly what
//! `advance_after_stage` consults. So the two mechanisms coexist on one board
//! rather than fighting, and no parallel "stage" concept is introduced.
