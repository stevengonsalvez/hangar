//! **Comment `@mention` routing** (multica parity #2-rest).
//!
//! One function, [`route`], answers "who did this comment address, and what did
//! we do about each of them". It is the single seam behind BOTH the daemon's
//! `hangar/comment_add` write and its `hangar/comment_mention_preview` dry run —
//! and behind the CLI's store-direct equivalents — precisely so a preview can
//! never disagree with the write it previews (multica step 10, and the
//! visibility-gate-identical-on-both requirement of step 7).
//!
//! # What changed relative to the pre-2-rest path
//!
//! The old `spawn_mention_tasks` returned only the agent ids it managed to
//! enqueue. A refused target was a silent `continue`, a repeat mention was a
//! swallowed unique-constraint violation, and a human `@handle` matched no agent
//! and vanished. Every one of those is now a REPORTED [`MentionRouteRow`] with a
//! [`MentionOutcome`] and, where one applies, a [`DispatchReason`].
//!
//! # The algorithm (each step cites the multica step it mirrors)
//!
//! 1. Parse the body ([`ainb_hangar_core::mention::parse`]). A reply that
//!    mentions nobody INHERITS its parent's mentions, under multica's three
//!    narrowing conditions (`shouldInheritParentMentions`, `comment.go:389`):
//!    the reply has no mentions of its own, its author is not an agent, and the
//!    parent's author is a member.
//! 2. Resolve every parsed target, workspace-scoped.
//! 3. **Explicit beats implicit** (multica step 2): if anything resolved, the
//!    fallback chain is skipped entirely.
//! 4. Otherwise walk the fallback chain, first hit wins (multica step 4):
//!    reply-parent author → thread-root author → issue assignee, each only when
//!    it is an AGENT.
//! 5. Act per target, one row each, never an early return, so one refused handle
//!    can never suppress the others.
//!
//! # Divergences from multica, deliberate
//!
//! * **Members and unresolvable handles are reported.** multica's outcome array
//!   only ever describes agent triggers. See [`MentionOutcome`]'s own docs.
//! * **No `mentioned` activity row.** hangar's `activity_log.action` is a closed
//!   CHECK-constrained set with no mention verb; adding one is a schema change
//!   this item does not need, since the inbox entry + subscription already make
//!   the human-routing leg observable. Left for the activity-vocabulary item.
//! * **An explicit mention bypasses the blocker gate**, matching multica's "no
//!   status gate here — an `@`mention is an explicit action" (`comment.go:~410`).
//!   Only a FALLBACK target is deferred behind unfinished blockers, because
//!   nobody asked for it by name.
