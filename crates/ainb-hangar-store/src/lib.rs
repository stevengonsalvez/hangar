//! Hangar persistence layer.
//!
//! Owns the `SQLite` schema (via embedded [`sqlx`] migrations) and the
//! repository wrappers that the daemon and services build on. This crate is the
//! single source of truth for the on-disk shape of `~/.agents-in-a-box/hangar.db`.
//!
//! # Migrations
//!
//! Migrations live in `migrations/` and follow the frozen naming convention
//! `NNNN_<terse_slug>.sql` (4-digit zero-padded ordinal, `snake_case` slug, no
//! `_up`/`_down` suffix — `SQLite` migrations are forward-only here). They are
//! embedded at compile time by [`sqlx::migrate!`], which on stable Rust
//! cannot register `migrations/` as a build dependency on its own; `build.rs`
//! emits `cargo:rerun-if-changed=migrations` so cargo rebuilds this crate
//! whenever a `.sql` file is added, edited, or removed. If a migration edit
//! is somehow still not picked up, that is a `build.rs` regression, not
//! expected behavior (`cargo clean -p ainb-hangar-store` remains the escape
//! hatch, but should not be needed).
//!
//! ## An applied migration file is IMMUTABLE — including its comments
//!
//! `sqlx` records a checksum of each migration's FULL FILE TEXT in
//! `_sqlx_migrations`. Editing an already-applied file — even a comment — changes
//! that checksum, and the next boot against an existing database aborts with
//! `migration N was previously applied but has been modified`, i.e. the daemon
//! refuses to start on every home that ever booted. Corrections to an applied
//! migration's prose therefore CANNOT be made in-file; document the correction
//! here (or in the owning repo module) instead. Only brand-new migrations are
//! editable, and only until they ship.
//!
//! ## D3 (migration 0053) is REVERSED by migration 0074
//!
//! `0053_squad_role_instructions.sql` states, as "DEVIATION (D3)", that
//! `squad_member.role` does NOT gate dispatch: that `SquadRepo::member_agent_ids`
//! stays role-blind, that every agent member is dispatched to regardless of role,
//! and that selective routing is deferred to parity item #16.
//!
//! **That is no longer true, and 0053's file cannot say so** (an applied
//! migration's text is frozen, see above). Dispatch IS role-gated as of migration
//! `0074_role_gated_pull_pipeline`: `role` is matched against
//! `board_column.services_role` in
//! [`service::pull::PullService`], and
//! [`service::squad_assign::SquadAssignService::assign_fanout`] no longer emits
//! one task per member at all. The old broadcast was the reported defect, not a
//! feature: one issue became N simultaneous runs, each in its own worktree, all
//! doing the same work.
//!
//! `member_agent_ids` itself is still role-blind, deliberately. It answers the
//! narrower question "which agents are in this squad", which is what the leader
//! briefing and the explicit `--redundant N` fan-out want. Role SELECTION lives
//! in the pull predicate.
//!
//! ## Foreign keys ARE enforced
//!
//! Several applied migration comments (0009/0010/0016/0017/0018/0027/0036) claim
//! "`PRAGMA foreign_keys` is off in this crate". That is **false and frozen**:
//! `sqlx` turns `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON` on by default for every `SQLite`
//! connection and [`Store::open_in`] never disables it, so every declared
//! `REFERENCES` IS engine-enforced (e.g. `agent.runtime_id` cannot be orphaned,
//! and `0010`'s `autopilot_run_id` link is a real constraint, not documentation).
//! Those comments cannot be corrected in place (see above) — this is the
//! authoritative statement. Where a table declares NO foreign key, that is a
//! deliberate schema choice (a polymorphic actor-ref, or a link an FK could not
//! tenant-scope), NOT a consequence of FKs being off; the service-layer guards
//! those repos apply are still required, because an FK proves only that a parent
//! row exists, never which workspace owns it.
