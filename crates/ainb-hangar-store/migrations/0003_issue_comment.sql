-- Hangar v1 schema, migration 0003: issues and comments with polymorphic actors.
--
-- An `issue` is a unit of work in a workspace. Both its assignee and its creator
-- are *polymorphic actors*: each is a `(type, id)` pair where `type` is one of
-- `member` or `agent`. There is deliberately NO foreign key on the `_id`
-- columns — the actor may live in either the `member` or `agent` table, and
-- SQLite cannot express a conditional FK. The `_type` CHECK constraint is what
-- keeps the column honest; integrity of the `_id` half is enforced at the
-- service layer (per the reference architecture review §7).
--
-- The `assignee` is optional (an unassigned issue is valid), so both
-- `assignee_type` and `assignee_id` are nullable. The `creator` is mandatory.
--
-- A `comment` belongs to exactly one `issue` and cascades on issue deletion. Its
-- `author` is the same polymorphic actor pattern (mandatory).
--
-- All timestamps are epoch milliseconds stored as INTEGER (see 0001).
