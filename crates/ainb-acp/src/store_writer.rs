//! Transcript chunks -> `fleet_provider_event` rows, on a commit cadence.
//!
//! Graft 1: there is no transcript table. ACP rows ride the existing ledger
//! with `source = 'acp'`, `event_type = 'acp.<kind>'` and `ingest_order` as the
//! cursor, which buys the idempotent `event_id` insert and the `raw_blake3`
//! integrity check for free (both are computed by the Phase 1 repo function,
//! not here: repo functions are the ONE door to the store).
//!
//! ## Cadence, not per-chunk commits
//!
//! Flush on whichever comes first: a [`WriterConfig::flush_bytes`] batch or
//! [`WriterConfig::flush_interval`]. Chunk coalescing bounds the ROW count;
//! only a cadence bounds the COMMIT count, and every commit takes the single
//! `SQLite` write lock the whole control plane shares.
//!
//! The interval is CALLER-DRIVEN: this crate owns no task and no timer (that
//! is what makes it hostable by a standalone process), so a writer that is
//! never touched never commits on its own. The pump MUST call
//! [`StoreWriter::tick`] on the interval, or a slow turn (one thought chunk,
//! then a five-minute tool call) streams nothing until the next chunk lands
//! and I12's "chunks arrive DURING the turn" fails for that window.
//!
//! ## Nothing RETRYABLE is lost on a failed commit
//!
//! [`StoreWriter::flush`] puts the batch BACK in the buffer when the store
//! rejects it for a reason that can clear. The store's own comment
//! (`store.rs:84`) warns that a contended writer can exhaust its 10 s
//! `busy_timeout`, and this crate is the new heavy writer, so a failed flush
//! has to be retryable rather than a hole in the transcript.
//!
//! Two things bound that generosity, because "restore and retry forever" is how
//! a writer turns a store fault into a daemon-wide memory incident:
//!
//! * A batch that can NEVER commit
//!   ([`FleetProviderEventError::is_permanent`]) is dropped rather than
//!   restored. Restoring it pins it at the head of the buffer: every later
//!   flush retries the same doomed rows and nothing behind them ever commits.
//! * The buffer is capped at [`MAX_BUFFERED_BYTES`]. Past it the OLDEST rows
//!   go, so the live tail of the conversation survives.
//!
//! Neither path is silent. Both leave one [`TRANSCRIPT_TRUNCATED`] marker row
//! in the buffer, so the transcript ADMITS the hole instead of skipping it.
//!
//! ## No broker
//!
//! Every flush RETURNS its [`HighWater`] mark instead of emitting anything. The
//! daemon's pool owns `transcript_tx`, so this crate stays a library that a
//! standalone process could host unchanged.
