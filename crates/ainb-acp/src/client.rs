//! The adapter process and the protocol conversation with it.
//!
//! Everything on the wire comes from the UPSTREAM `agent-client-protocol`
//! crate, pinned to an exact 1.x. Nothing here re-implements a schema type or a
//! framing rule.
//!
//! Four invariants live in this file, each of them a bug the spike actually
//! observed:
//!
//! * **Handler before load.** The `session/update` handler is registered on the
//!   builder, which is consumed BEFORE the connection exists, so no request can
//!   possibly be issued first. `session/load` replays history as notifications
//!   AHEAD of its own reply; a handler registered after the call would silently
//!   drop the whole conversation. The plan calls this the single most likely
//!   implementation bug in the port, so it is closed by construction rather
//!   than by ordering discipline.
//! * **Mode pinning (I13).** The spike saw `claude-agent-acp` report
//!   `currentModeId: bypassPermissions` inherited from ambient state, and as a
//!   direct consequence zero agent-to-client requests fired across every probe.
//!   Every session therefore asserts its configured mode and a failure to prove
//!   it is a hard spawn failure, never a warning. The assertion does not stop
//!   at spawn: every later `current_mode_update` is recorded, and
//!   [`AdapterProcess::mode_violated`] is the standing check the pool consults
//!   before it prompts.
//! * **Allowlisted child environment (I13).** `env_clear` then an explicit
//!   list. The daemon's environment is not the adapter's business, and ambient
//!   inheritance is how the mode leak happened in the first place.
//! * **Every reply inspected.** `-32602` is surfaced as
//!   [`AcpError::InvalidParams`], never swallowed. The spike lost an entire
//!   probe run to `session/set_config_option` taking `configId` rather than
//!   `optionId`: the wrong name errored, the error was ignored, and the run
//!   silently continued on the default model.
//!
//! ## Drift from the plan (upstream API)
//!
//! The plan says `session/new` "ALWAYS carries an explicit mode". The pinned
//! upstream `NewSessionRequest` has no mode field (v1 has none), so the mode is
//! asserted instead: read `currentModeId` from the reply, and if it is not the
//! configured mode issue `session/set_session_mode` and require the adapter to
//! ECHO the new mode back as a `current_mode_update` notification within
//! [`MODE_ASSERT_TIMEOUT`]. No echo means the mode is unproven, which fails the
//! spawn exactly like a mismatch: an unverifiable permission mode is the very
//! state the spike proved is dangerous.
