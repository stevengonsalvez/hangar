//! Card-board widget (63l.1): a Linear-style status board — N columns side by
//! side, each a vertical stack of sleek bordered cards.
//!
//! This replaces the sparse [`SectionBands`](crate::screen::issue_list) density
//! pass on the issue list (vertical bands of bare rows) with a horizontal board:
//! one column per canonical [`IssueLifecycle`] status, each column a header
//! (status glyph + name + count, with room for the `⋯` context and `+` create
//! affordances the mouse layer wires in P0.2) above a scrollable stack of
//! bordered, rounded cards.
//!
//! ## Pure render + a layout model
//!
//! Like every widget here, the board is a **pure render helper**: it takes a
//! [`WireBuffer`], an area, and the data to paint, and emits cells. It holds no
//! state and does no IO. The selection and the per-column scroll offsets are
//! passed in by the caller's reducer state (the issue list owns them).
//!
//! Crucially, the render also *returns* a [`BoardLayout`] — the on-screen
//! geometry it just painted: every column's [`Rect`] and every visible card's
//! [`Rect`], tagged with the issue id it draws. P0.2 hit-tests a mouse click
//! against this layout to resolve "which card / which column header / which `+`
//! affordance was clicked" without re-deriving the geometry. The render is the
//! single source of truth for where things landed, so the hit-test can never
//! drift from the paint.
//!
//! ## Card anatomy
//!
//! ```text
//! ╭──────────────────╮      ╭──────────────────╮  ← rounded border (selected:
//! │ HGR-9            │      ┃ HGR-12           ┃    heavy clay border)
//! │ Refactor the API │      ┃ Wire the mouse   ┃
//! │ layer end to end │      ┃ hit-test into …  ┃  ← title, 2 lines, ellipsis
//! │ ◆ Urgent ◔ impl-1│      ┃ ◔ rev-1 · run 2m ┃  ← footer, swaps by state
//! ╰──────────────────╯      ╰──────────────────╯
//! ```
//!
//! The id line is muted; the title wraps to two lines with an ellipsis on
//! overflow; the footer swaps by state (crisp B2 §2.2) — the attention code when
//! something is asking, else the run chip, else the colour-coded priority chip
//! ([`PriorityChip`]) with an assignee glyph. A selected card swaps the rounded
//! border for a heavy "clay" border so the eye lands on it immediately.
//!
//! ## Empty columns
//!
//! An empty column is never a void: it paints a centered dashed-border
//! placeholder ([`render_empty_placeholder`]) so the board reads as "this status
//! has no issues" rather than "the render broke".
//!
//! Char-safe throughout: every write iterates `char`s, never bytes
//! (`reference_rust_utf8_truncate_trap`), and every paint is clipped to the
//! column's right edge so a card never bleeds into its neighbour, even at the
//! 80×24 floor (`project_ainb_tui_width_aware_panels`).
