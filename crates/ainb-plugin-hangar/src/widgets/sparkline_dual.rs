//! P8.5 — the dual-dimension throughput sparkline widget.
//!
//! A normal sparkline encodes a single series as cell height. The daemon-health
//! pane needs **two** independent signals per second: how many tasks finished
//! (throughput) and how many of those failed (failure rate). This widget encodes
//! both at once, per the P8.5 UX research:
//!
//!   * **height** of a column = total throughput that second (`completed +
//!     failed`), scaled into the available rows;
//!   * **red proportion** of that column = the failure rate (`failed / total`):
//!     the bottom (success) portion is painted [`SPARK_GREEN`], the top (failure)
//!     portion [`SPARK_RED`].
//!
//! Both signals are recoverable independently from a rendered column: the total
//! height reads off the throughput, and the green/red split reads off the failure
//! rate — neither aliases the other. A second with no terminal tasks renders an
//! empty (zero-height) column.
//!
//! ## Geometry
//!
//! The widget paints one column per [`ThroughputSample`] across `[x0, x0 + n)`,
//! `n` columns wide and `rows` rows tall (`top ..= top + rows - 1`), bottom-
//! anchored. Heights scale linearly against the window's peak total so the tallest
//! second always reaches the full `rows` height (an all-zero window paints
//! nothing). Each filled cell uses a partial-block glyph for sub-row resolution at
//! the top of a column, the way ratatui's `Sparkline` does, so adjacent columns of
//! slightly different totals are visually distinguishable.
