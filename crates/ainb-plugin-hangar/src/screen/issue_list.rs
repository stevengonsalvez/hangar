//! P4.3 — Issue list screen: the pure reducer + width-aware render.
//!
//! The issue list is the default landing screen (hotkey `1`). It renders a
//! workspace's [`IssueRow`]s grouped by lifecycle status into the five canonical
//! columns — Backlog / Todo / In Progress / In Review / Done (63l.3) — with row
//! selection, filter chips, and a type-narrow filter-input mode. As with the
//! screen router ([`crate::screen`]),
//! the reducer ([`reduce_issue_list`]) is **pure**: it folds a key press or a
//! host [`HangarEvent`] into a new [`IssueListState`] plus an optional
//! [`IssueListIntent`] for the plugin glue to act on (open a task, start the
//! create flow). No IO, no `tokio`, no socket — so every transition is
//! exhaustively unit-testable, which is what the P4.3 RED tests in
//! `tests/issue_list_reducer_test.rs` exercise.
//!
//! The plugin holds **zero domain data of its own**
//! (`project_ainb_plugin_owns_data_plane`): the cached rows are the daemon's
//! read model, pulled over RPC and kept current by folding the event stream.
//! `IssueListState` is that render-state cache and nothing more.
//!
//! Status grouping maps each wire `state` through [`IssueColumn::for_state`],
//! which delegates to the shared canonical five-status `IssueLifecycle`
//! (Backlog / Todo / In Progress / In Review / Done), folding legacy strings
//! (`open` / `closed`) forward into the right column. A `TaskStarted` event promotes
//! the task's issue into In Progress without waiting for an `IssueUpdated`,
//! because the daemon reports task lifecycle before it rewrites the issue row.
