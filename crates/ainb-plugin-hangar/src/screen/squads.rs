//! P7 — Squads screen: the pure reducer + width-aware render (D17).
//!
//! The Squads screen (hotkey `S`) is the TUI surface over the daemon-native team
//! primitive: a workspace-scoped squad is a LEADER agent plus member actors, and
//! assigning an issue to a squad briefs the leader (and fans out to the agent
//! members). This screen lists every squad with its leader + members, each row
//! carrying a live presence dot (resolved from the cached `hangar/agents_list`
//! snapshot), and drives the squad RPCs:
//!
//!   * `c` — create a squad (inline name input; the daemon `squad_create`, with
//!     the leader chosen by the glue from the cached agents);
//!   * `a` — add a member to the selected squad (`squad_member_add`);
//!   * `d` — remove the selected MEMBER row (`squad_member_remove`);
//!   * `x` — assign the current issue to the selected squad — leader-routing
//!     dispatch that fans out to the members (`squad_fanout`).
//!
//! Like every Hangar screen the reducer ([`reduce_squads`]) is **pure**: it folds
//! a key event into a new [`SquadsState`] plus an optional [`SquadsIntent`] (which
//! the plugin glue lifts into the matching daemon JSON-RPC). The squad rows come
//! from the daemon (`hangar/squads_list`); the plugin owns zero domain data
//! (`project_ainb_plugin_owns_data_plane`). The leader/member/issue *selection*
//! policy for the create/add/assign verbs lives in the glue (which caches the
//! agents + issues), so the intents carry only ids — keeping this reducer free of
//! IO and of the actor catalogue.
