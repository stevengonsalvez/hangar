//! The Fleet chat surface: the operator's conversation with the fleet Pal.
//!
//! Pure, exactly like the rest of [`super::fleet`]. This module owns no socket:
//! it folds host-supplied wire rows into state, emits typed intents the host
//! executes, and paints into a [`WireBuffer`]. Every RPC named in a doc comment
//! here is issued by `ainb-core`, never from this crate.
//!
//! Three things in here are load-bearing, and all three are the same class of
//! bug the ACP provider label shipped with (a fact mapped TWICE, with only one
//! half updated):
//!
//! 1. **Attribution.** `fleet/message_send` carries an `actor` precisely so a
//!    Pal-authored write is distinguishable from a human's. That guarantee
//!    dies at the last inch if the panel paints both rows the same, so
//!    [`ChatActor`] is an enum with an exhaustive label mapping, and a blank
//!    sender renders as [`ChatActor::Unattributed`] rather than degrading into
//!    the operator.
//! 2. **Answerability.** A confirm card is answerable ONLY in
//!    [`FleetConfirmState::Open`], decided by an exhaustive match so a new
//!    lifecycle state fails to compile here instead of silently rendering an
//!    approve key. A card whose frame this build cannot decode at all becomes
//!    [`ChatConfirmCard::Unrecognised`], which is never answerable — the mirror
//!    of the macOS client's `isAnswerable` rule, and the reason the confirm
//!    list is decoded card-by-card from raw JSON rather than as one typed
//!    `Vec<FleetConfirm>` that a single unknown token would reject wholesale.
//! 3. **Display tokens.** Every wire enum this screen renders (message kind,
//!    confirm state, activity class, activity outcome) is mapped with a
//!    wildcard-free match, so adding a variant upstream is a compile error in
//!    this file rather than an `UNKNOWN` on the one screen an operator reads.
