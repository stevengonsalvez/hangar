//! P4 / D8 — the user-defined Boards screen (hotkey `B`).
//!
//! The Boards screen renders the workspace's USER-DEFINED kanban boards (the P4
//! upgrade over the fixed four-column [`kanban`](crate::screen::kanban) task
//! board, which it lives alongside — additive, no regression). A board has any
//! number of ordered columns, each optionally mapped to a task-FSM status so a
//! card AUTO-MOVES there when its work reaches that state (`card = issue`). The
//! daemon owns the data (`hangar/boards_list`); this screen is a pure view over a
//! [`BoardsListResult`] snapshot plus a focus cursor, and its reducer lifts every
//! mutation into the matching `hangar/board_*` RPC — the plugin owns zero domain
//! state (`project_ainb_plugin_owns_data_plane`).
//!
//! ## What renders
//!
//! The focused board's columns paint THROUGH the shared card-board widget
//! ([`card_board`]) so the Boards screen looks like every other board surface. A
//! card shows `#<display_id>`, the issue title, and — when its latest task
//! `done` — a leading `✓` success marker (the card-green-on-succeeded signal in
//! text form; the colour gate is the vhs frame-read layer). A board's cards whose
//! column was deleted render in a trailing `unmapped` pseudo-column so they never
//! vanish. A hint band under the board title renders the column/card key bindings
//! NEXT to the widget (`feedback_keybinding_hints_near_control`).
//!
//! ## Reducer
//!
//! [`reduce_boards`] folds a [`BoardsEvent`] into a new [`BoardsState`] plus an
//! optional [`BoardsIntent`] the glue lifts into a daemon RPC (run a card, attach
//! to it, add/rename/delete/reorder a column, add a card, toggle the board's
//! auto-move, create/delete a board). Pure: no IO, no input mutation.
