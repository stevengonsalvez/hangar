//! The plugin's render-state cache + render/key dispatch over the Core 5 screens
//! (P4.10 connecting tissue).
//!
//! P4.1–P4.8 landed five **pure** screen reducers + width-aware renderers, but
//! `plugin::render` painted only the shared chrome and `handle_key` never reached
//! a screen reducer. This module is the glue: [`ScreenStates`] caches each
//! screen's render state (filled from the daemon snapshot RPCs), [`render_body`]
//! dispatches the active [`Screen`] to its renderer over the chrome body rows,
//! and [`route_key`] folds a forwarded key into the active screen's reducer and
//! surfaces any cross-screen [`NavIntent`] back to the plugin glue (open a task,
//! open the picker, switch tabs).
//!
//! The plugin still owns **zero domain data** — every cache here is filled from a
//! daemon snapshot and folded by the daemon's event stream.
