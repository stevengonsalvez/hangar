//! P8.4 — Kanban board screen: four columns + card widget.
//!
//! The Kanban board (hotkey `K`) lays the workspace's task queue out as four
//! width-aware columns — `queued` / `running` / `done` / `failed` — each holding
//! the task cards bucketed into it. A card's ID LINE reads
//! `#<short_id> · <parent issue title>`; its TITLE line carries the run identity:
//! the assignee agent BY NAME, the task age (`5m` / `2h` / `3d`), the status, and
//! the run's durable artifacts (branch + PR chip).
//!
//! Focus walks columns with `←` / `→` and rows with `↑` / `↓`; `Shift+←` / `Shift+→`
//! drags the focused card to the adjacent column, which the plugin glue lifts
//! into a `hangar/task_transition` daemon RPC (the real store FSM move, not a
//! local re-bucket).
//!
//! ## Status → column mapping
//!
//! The real lifecycle has **six** statuses
//! ([`ainb_hangar_core::task_status::TaskStatus`]:
//! `queued/dispatched/running/done/failed/cancelled`); the board has four
//! columns. The mapping ([`BoardColumn::for_status`]) folds the pending pair and
//! the failed pair so every status lands in exactly one column:
//!
//! | column    | statuses                |
//! |-----------|-------------------------|
//! | `queued`  | `queued`, `dispatched`  |
//! | `running` | `running`               |
//! | `done`    | `done`                  |
//! | `failed`  | `failed`, `cancelled`   |
//!
//! An unknown wire token falls into `queued` (fail-visible, not fail-hidden) so a
//! future status never silently drops a card off the board.
//!
//! ## Two ids the card must NOT show raw
//!
//! A [`TaskCardRow`] carries an `agent_id` and an `issue_id`, both 26-char ULIDs.
//! Painted raw they swamp a ~27-char card line and read as noise. Worse, N
//! dispatch runs of ONE issue (a squad fan-out, or a rerun) become N opaque,
//! seemingly unrelated cards. Both are therefore resolved CLIENT-SIDE against
//! snapshots the plugin already holds (the `hangar/agents_list` roster and the
//! `hangar/issues_list` rows) by [`KanbanState::set_agent_names`] and
//! [`KanbanState::set_issue_titles`]. No wire field carries the resolved text.
//!
//! Both seams are idempotent and order-independent: the three snapshots are fired
//! in one batch and land in any order, so each is applied from BOTH sides (the
//! tasks snapshot resolves against the cached rosters, and each roster snapshot
//! re-resolves the cards already on the board). An id that resolves to nothing
//! (a deleted agent, an orphan task) falls back to a SHORT form, never the ULID.
//!
//! ## Why the parent issue sits on the ID line, not the title
//!
//! The card widget wraps its title to exactly TWO lines and ellipsis-cuts the
//! overflow, while its id line carries `#<short_id>` alone and is ~35 cells of
//! dead space. Leading the TITLE with the parent issue therefore spent the run's
//! own budget on context and pushed the tail off the tile: a finished run's `PR ✓`
//! chip was silently elided (`tripwire_tcp_card_branch_pr_e2e`). The parent is
//! context and belongs on the identity line beside the id; the title line is the
//! run (agent, age, status, branch, PR) and keeps its whole two-line budget.
//!
//! As with every Hangar screen the reducer ([`reduce_kanban`]) is **pure**: it
//! folds a directional / move / event input into a new [`KanbanState`] plus an
//! optional [`KanbanIntent`] the plugin glue lifts into the matching daemon RPC.
//! The card rows come from the daemon (`hangar/tasks_list`); the plugin owns zero
//! domain data (`project_ainb_plugin_owns_data_plane`).
