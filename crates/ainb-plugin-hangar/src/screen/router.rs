//! The pure screen-routing reducer.
//!
//! [`reduce`] is the single entry point through which every key press and host
//! event flows. It owns the tab-switch / modal / quit semantics of P4.1:
//!
//! - `1` / `,` switch to the issue-list / settings tabs, and `K` / `B` / `I` /
//!   `A` to the four lettered ones (crisp B5 §2.5 cut the strip from sixteen
//!   tabs to seven; the nine demoted screens keep their reducers and are reached
//!   through the `Go:` palette family instead — [`super::command_palette`]).
//! - `2` switches to task detail **only** when a task is selected (otherwise a
//!   no-op, per the RED test `reduce_tab_key_2_only_valid_when_task_selected`).
//! - `?` opens the [help overlay](Screen::Help) modal, remembering the screen
//!   it overlaid so Esc can restore it.
//! - [`AppEvent::OpenAgentPicker`] opens the agent-picker modal, remembering
//!   the screen it overlaid so Esc can restore it.
//! - `Esc` closes a modal back to [`AppState::prior_screen`].
//! - `q` emits [`Intent::Quit`] without changing the screen.
//!
//! Unknown keys and invalid transitions return the input state unchanged with
//! no intent, so the function is total over `(AppState, AppEvent)`.
