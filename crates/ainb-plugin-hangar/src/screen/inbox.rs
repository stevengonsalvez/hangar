//! e38.14 / crisp B3 §2.4 — Inbox: the ONE attention surface.
//!
//! The hangar grew three places that say "a human is needed": the Control
//! Center (`C`), this inbox (`I`), and the board's attention flag. Crisp B3
//! makes this screen the surface and the other two views of the same store.
//!
//! ```text

//!
//! **`needs you`** is EVERY open `attention/list` row, not only the ones that
//! need a decision: an `ERR` or an `IDLE` row is something a human must see,
//! and hiding it here would leave it on no surface at all. The header's
//! `[N need you]` badge counts the narrower set (the ASK-family rows, via
//! [`ControlCenterState::needs_you_count`]), so the block and the badge are
//! deliberately different numbers — one is "what is open", the other "what is
//! blocking an agent".
//!
//! A consequence of §2.1's four-code collapse: an `approval` or a
//! `codex_request_user` row reads `ASK` and counts toward the badge, but the
//! options come from the PAYLOAD, so what a row renders depends on what it
//! carries. A structured `ask_user_question` and an ACP adapter's parked
//! permission (`acp_permission`, an `approval` row) both paint ①②③ and answer
//! inline; a payload carrying no options shows the "surfaced for visibility"
//! note instead. That note was written for `codex_request_user`, which no
//! producer in the tree constructs today, so it is reached only by a payload
//! neither surface can parse. `ASK` is the vocabulary's word for "a question is
//! waiting", not a promise that this pane can answer it; free-text answering is
//! still not B3's work.
//!
//! The rows are the SAME [`ControlCenterState`] the Control Center paints,
//! handed in at render time rather than copied, so the two surfaces cannot
//! disagree about what is waiting. The inline answer is
//! [`control_center::render_options`] paired with
//! [`reduce_control_center`](super::control_center::reduce_control_center):
//! moved, not rewritten, so `I` raises the identical `attention/answer` RPC `C`
//! raises — including its refusal note, painted on the header.
//!
//! **`recent`** is the durable `hangar/inbox_list` aggregate — events that
//! survive a detach. The wire row carries a pre-rendered `summary` full of ULIDs
//! (`Task started: 01M1GVN6...`), so each line is recomposed locally (crisp B1):
//! `subject_id` resolves through an [`InboxLookup`] to the agent name and the
//! issue's `HGR-n title`, `event` becomes a lowercase verb + glyph from
//! [`crate::vocab`], and `created_at` a relative age. A row nothing resolves
//! keeps the daemon's summary, never a blank. Failed runs float to the top of
//! their age bucket.
//!
//! That leading glyph is the run STATE (§2.4's target), which is why B1's
//! separate per-row unread dot is gone: read state is now carried by colour
//! (amber unread, soft white read) plus the header's `[N unread]` badge, and `r`
//! still clears them all. Both glyph columns read one age ladder,
//! [`crate::vocab::age_word`].
//!
//! **Filters** `(all) asks runs issues` are client-side over the cached rows
//! (`f` cycles): no refetch, and every cached row is reachable from at least one
//! of them. `r` still raises the mark-all-read request the glue turns into
//! `hangar/inbox_mark_read`.
