//! P4.1 — Screen routing core: the pure render-state reducer.
//!
//! Hangar's TUI is a small state machine. [`AppState`] holds *which* of the
//! Core 5 screens is active, the optional active-task banner, and the
//! workspace it is bound to. [`reduce`] maps a `(&AppState, AppEvent)` pair to
//! a new [`AppState`] plus an optional [`Intent`] — it is **pure**: no IO, no
//! `tokio`, no socket. The plugin glue ([`crate::plugin`]) feeds host key /
//! event deliveries in and acts on the emitted intents (quit, open a task,
//! issue an RPC). Keeping the routing logic IO-free makes every transition
//! exhaustively unit-testable, which is exactly what the P4.1 RED tests in
//! `tests/screen_router_test.rs` exercise.
//!
//! The shared chrome (top tab bar + footer) that wraps every screen lives in
//! [`crate::chrome`]; this module owns only the routing state it renders from.
