//! P4.4 — Task detail + transcript screen: the pure reducer + width-aware render.
//!
//! The task-detail screen (hotkey `2`, or `enter` on an issue-list row) shows a
//! single task: a detail card (the issue title, ONE meta line, acceptance and
//! properties) above the streaming transcript. As with every Hangar screen, the
//! reducer ([`reduce_task_detail`]) is
//! **pure** — it folds a key press or a host [`HangarEvent`] into a new
//! [`TaskDetailState`] plus an optional [`TaskDetailIntent`] for the plugin glue
//! to act on (retry / cancel the task). No IO, no `tokio`, no socket, so every
//! transition is exhaustively unit-testable (the P4.4 RED tests in
//! `tests/transcript_reducer_test.rs`).
//!
//! The plugin holds **zero domain data of its own**
//! (`project_ainb_plugin_owns_data_plane`): the transcript is the daemon's
//! task event stream, folded into a render-state cache. [`TaskDetailState`] is
//! that cache and nothing more.
//!
//! ## Streaming append + sticky-bottom auto-scroll
//!
//! Each [`HangarEvent::TaskMessage`] (and interleaved [`HangarEvent::CommentAdded`])
//! addressed to the bound task lands at the *bottom* of the transcript in arrival
//! order. While the viewport is *stuck to the bottom* the scroll offset tracks the
//! tail so the newest line stays visible; the moment the user scrolls up (`k`)
//! sticky releases and new messages no longer move the viewport off the user's
//! position — they re-stick only by scrolling back to the bottom (`G` / `j` past
//! the end).
//!
//! ## Retry / cancel lifecycle gating
//!
//! `R` (retry) is only meaningful once the task reached a terminal state
//! (succeeded / failed); `X` (cancel) is only meaningful while it is running, and
//! opens a confirm modal (Esc aborts, Enter confirms → [`TaskDetailIntent::CancelTask`]).
//! The reducer tracks lifecycle from the task events themselves so these keys are
//! total no-ops when not applicable. `x` (delete the bound issue) opens its own
//! confirm modal the same way (Esc aborts, Enter → [`TaskDetailIntent::DeleteIssue`]);
//! it is not lifecycle-gated — the daemon rejects a delete with active tasks and
//! that rejection surfaces as a note.
//!
//! ## Collapsible thinking runs
//!
//! A long consecutive run of [`MessageKind::Thinking`] lines is a UX-§7 grouping
//! candidate: the raw transcript keeps every line, but the *visible* view folds a
//! run of [`THINKING_COLLAPSE_THRESHOLD`] or more into a single collapsed-group
//! entry so reasoning doesn't bury the prose + tool flow.
