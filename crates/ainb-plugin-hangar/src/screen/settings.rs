//! P4.7 — Settings screen: the pure reducer + section-stacked width-aware render.
//!
//! The settings screen (hotkey `,`) has seven j/k-navigable sections. The first
//! five:
//!
//! 1. **Daemon connection** — socket path, PID, uptime, version, connection state
//!    (from the `hangar/health` RPC snapshot).
//! 2. **Providers** — registered LLM providers with online/offline status.
//! 3. **LLM keys** — a masked list; `n` opens the key-entry modal (writes to the
//!    OS keychain via the `host/secret_store_get` cap), `d` deletes.
//! 4. **Workspace** (P5.5) — a `slug · name [default]` table with the active
//!    workspace marked `▶` in `SELECTION_GREEN`. `s` sets the selected row
//!    active (emits a `SwitchWorkspace` intent → `host/workspace_set_active`),
//!    `d` toggles default, `n` creates a new workspace, `r` renames the
//!    selected one. `J`/`K` move the in-pane selection.
//! 5. **Members** (e38.11) — a render-only `email · role` list (the `owner` role
//!    in `SELECTION_GREEN`). The mutation surface is CLI-first
//!    (`ainb hangar member set-role|remove`); the pane lets the operator see who
//!    holds which role from the `hangar/members_list` snapshot. Under the member
//!    rows the same snapshot's LIVE pending invitations (parity #18) paint behind
//!    a `Pending invites` sub-header — `email · role · expires in Nd` — so an
//!    invited-but-not-yet-joined human is visible. Nothing paints when there are
//!    none.
//! 6. **Notifications** (tcp T5) — the attention-kind × channel routing grid.
//! 7. **More screens** (crisp B5 §2.5) — the nine screens the tab-strip shrink
//!    demoted, each beside the `^P` word that reaches it. Read-only.
//!
//! The reducer ([`reduce_settings`]) is **pure**. The crucial security property
//! (P4.7 risk register, "keychain write leaks key into log"): entered key
//! material is wrapped in [`KeyMaterial`], whose `Debug` impl **redacts** the
//! value, so neither a `{:?}` log nor a panic message can leak a secret. Only
//! [`KeyMaterial::expose`] reveals the raw bytes, at the single call site that
//! performs the actual keychain write.
