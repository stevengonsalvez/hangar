//! Crisp B2 §2.1 — the ONE status vocabulary every hangar screen renders from.
//!
//! The audit found four vocabularies for one idea: the task FSM writes
//! `running/done/failed/cancelled`, the inbox paints `Success/Failure/Cancelled`,
//! the usage dashboard `success/failed`, and the Fleet pane both `RUN/DONE` and
//! `Running/Completed`. Same run, four words, so nothing on screen can be
//! compared to anything else.
//!
//! ```text
//! run/task    ○ queued   ◔ running   ● done   ✗ failed   ⊘ cancelled
//! issue       backlog · todo · in progress · in review · done · blocked · cancelled
//! attention   ASK · ERR · IDLE · WAIT
//! fleet lens  needs input · running · idle · done
//! ```
//!
//! Rules: **lowercase everywhere except the four attention codes**, and one glyph
//! per token, shared. Never `Success`, never `DONE`, never `Completed`.
//!
//! [`RunState::of`] is total over the CHECK'd task FSM, and each token carries
//! its own glyph, so a screen can never pair the right word with the wrong mark.
//! The attention families map onto [`AttentionKind`] in exactly one place, named
//! on that type: it needs the parsed request body, not just the wire token.
//!
//! This module MAPS the daemon's three stores onto one vocabulary; it does not
//! merge them (PLAN.md "do not attempt in track B" #1). The stores collapse in
//! the spine work, and this table is what the screens read until they do.
