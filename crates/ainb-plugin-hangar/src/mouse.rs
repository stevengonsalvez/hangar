//! 63l.2 — the card-board mouse framework: a render-time hit-map, a
//! [`MouseState`] drag FSM, and the [`MouseIntent`]s every pointer gesture folds
//! into.
//!
//! ## The shape of the problem
//!
//! The host captures the terminal mouse (ainb-core `EnableMouseCapture`) and
//! forwards each event to the focused plugin as a viewport-relative
//! [`MouseEvent`](ainb_plugin_sdk::MouseEvent) via `plugin/handle_mouse`. The
//! hangar plugin consumed none of it before this bead. This module is the pure,
//! IO-free core that turns those events into board actions:
//!
//! ```text
//!   ┌─────────────┐   build    ┌──────────┐  hit_test  ┌────────────┐
//!   │ render(buf) │──────────▶ │  HitMap  │ ─────────▶ │  MouseFsm  │
//!   │ BoardLayout │  per frame │ Rect→Tgt │            │  handle()  │
//!   └─────────────┘            └──────────┘            └─────┬──────┘
//!                                                            │ MouseIntent
//!                                                            ▼
//!                                          drained next render/glue tick (P2 RPC)
//! ```
//!
//! ## Why a hit-map, not re-derived geometry
//!
//! The render is the single source of truth for *where things landed*. Rather
//! than re-deriving the column/card geometry in the mouse handler (which would
//! drift the instant the render changed), the render records a [`HitMap`] — a
//! flat `Vec<(Rect, Target)>` — and the handler hit-tests against it. The hit-map
//! is rebuilt each frame and lives in the screen's reducer state.
//!
//! ## Non-blocking by construction
//!
//! `plugin/handle_mouse` runs INLINE on the SDK reader loop (same as
//! `handle_key`), so the handler MUST NOT block on a socket. This module never
//! touches IO: it folds the event into the FSM and returns an intent. The plugin
//! glue stashes the intent and drains it on the next `render` (a spawned task,
//! where host IO is safe), exactly as the deferred key-path actions already do.
//! This bead emits the intents; P2 binds the mutating ones to daemon RPCs.
