//! Shared chrome: the top tab bar and bottom footer that wrap every screen.
//!
//! The chrome is the persistent frame around the Core 5 screens (P4.1). The
//! [top tab bar](render_top_bar) shows the seven primary tabs, the active
//! workspace slug, and an online/offline presence dot; the
//! [footer](render_footer) shows the contextual key hints for the active
//! screen. Both are **width-aware**: they derive their sub-region widths from
//! the supplied area rather than hard-coding columns, so they degrade
//! gracefully from a wide terminal down to the 80×24 floor without overflowing
//! (`project_ainb_tui_width_aware_panels`).
//!
//! Rendering targets the SDK [`WireBuffer`]; the plugin's `render` handler
//! composes the bar (row 0), the active screen body, and the footer (last row).
