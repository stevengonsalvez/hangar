//! Host-shell side effects for the Hangar plugin — opening a URL in the user's
//! browser (P9.2).
//!
//! The task-detail PR badge (`o`) needs to open the captured PR URL in the host
//! browser. That is a real OS side effect (`open` on macOS, `xdg-open` on Linux;
//! Windows is excluded by the Unix-only release matrix per
//! `reference_rust_unix_only_apis`), which makes the action untestable if the
//! handler shells out directly.
//!
//! [`Opener`] is the seam: the plugin holds a `Box<dyn Opener>` and calls
//! [`Opener::open`] for the `o` action. Production uses [`SystemOpener`]; tests
//! inject a [`RecordingOpener`] that writes the URL to a probe file instead of
//! launching a browser, so the tmux tripwire can assert the URL without a real
//! browser popping up.
//!
//! [`default_opener`] picks the impl from the environment: when
//! `$HANGAR_OPENER_PROBE_FILE` is set (the tripwire flips it) the real `ainb tui`
//! binary uses a [`RecordingOpener`] writing to that path; otherwise it uses the
//! real [`SystemOpener`]. So the same compiled binary the tripwire launches
//! records the URL rather than opening a browser, with zero production cost.
