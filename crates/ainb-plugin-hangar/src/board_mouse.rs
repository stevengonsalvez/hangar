//! 63l.6 — the list-screen mouse reducer: a lifecycle-free pointer fold over the
//! shared [`card_board::BoardLayout`](crate::widgets::card_board::BoardLayout) so
//! the Kanban / Autopilots / Skills screens are mouse-driven the same way the
//! issue board is.
//!
//! ## Why a second, simpler fold
//!
//! The issue board's [`MouseFsm`](crate::mouse::MouseFsm) is keyed on
//! [`IssueLifecycle`](ainb_hangar_proto::lifecycle::IssueLifecycle): its
//! [`Target`](crate::mouse::Target)s carry a lifecycle status because the issue
//! board supports a real cross-column drag that rewrites an issue's lifecycle
//! `state`. The other three list screens have **no user-driven cross-column
//! move**:
//!
//! - **Kanban** task lifecycle (`queued → running → done`) is DAEMON-driven, not
//!   user-draggable — a drag must never fabricate a fake state mutation.
//! - **Autopilots** / **Skills** are flat single-column lists — there is no second
//!   column to drag into.
//!
//! So binding those screens onto the lifecycle-typed FSM would be wrong (it would
//! invent a drag semantics none of them have). Instead this module folds the
//! SAME render-time geometry the card-board already produces
//! ([`BoardLayout::card_at`](crate::widgets::card_board::BoardLayout::card_at) /
//! [`column_at`](crate::widgets::card_board::BoardLayout::column_at)) into a small
//! id-keyed [`BoardMouseIntent`]: a click OPENS the card, a right-click anchors a
//! context menu, a wheel scrolls the column under the pointer, a move hovers. No
//! drag, no lifecycle, no fabricated mutation.
//!
//! ## Non-blocking, like every pointer path
//!
//! `plugin/handle_mouse` runs INLINE on the SDK reader loop, so this fold is pure
//! and IO-free: it resolves the event against the layout and returns an intent the
//! plugin glue stashes and drains on the next render (where host IO is safe),
//! exactly as the issue-board mouse path does.
