//! ABI v2 [`Plugin`] implementation for the Hangar control plane TUI.
//!
//! P3.7 wires the daemon connection into the plugin. On `plugin/init` the
//! plugin dials the daemon socket through the host `unix_socket_dial` cap,
//! sends a `workspace/subscribe` request framed over that cap stream, and
//! moves a [`Connection`] state machine `Disconnected → Dialing →
//! Handshake → Connected`. Inbound daemon frames arrive as
//! `socket:<stream_id>` `plugin/handle_event` notifications; the plugin
//! reassembles them with a [`FrameDecoder`] and acks the subscribe to
//! reach [`ConnState::Connected`].
//!
//! `render` paints the shared P4.1 chrome: the [top tab bar](crate::chrome)
//! on row 0 (four primary tabs + workspace slug + an online/offline presence
//! dot derived from the daemon link) and the contextual key-hint footer on the
//! last row. The screen body (rows `1..h-1`) is filled by the per-screen
//! renderers landing in P4.3..P4.7.
//!
//! Everything declared in `manifest.toml` — the four P3 host caps — is
//! requested here; this phase exercises `unix_socket_dial` +
//! `unix_socket_send`. `spawn_managed_subprocess` (auto-starting the
//! daemon) and `secret_store_get` land in later phases.
