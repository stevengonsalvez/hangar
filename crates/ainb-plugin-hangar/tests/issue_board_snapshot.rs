//! 63l.7 — Issues board render golden.
//!
//! The Issues screen is the headline of the mouse-driven board redesign (63l.4):
//! it renders THROUGH the shared Linear-style card-board widget — five status
//! columns side by side, each a per-column-scrollable stack of bordered cards.
//! This pins that render with an `insta` glyph golden (trailing newline trimmed
//! per `reference_insta_trailing_newline_trap`) so a regression to the old
//! vertical band layout — or a dropped column / id / priority chip — fails here
//! instead of silently shipping.
//!
//! A golden that only asserted "non-empty" would be vacuous, so the golden is
//! paired with explicit CELL-CONTENT assertions: every one of the five canonical
//! column headers with its live count, each seeded card's `HGR-<n>` display id,
//! and a coloured priority chip (label + glyph). The five-column horizontal
//! spread (Backlog left, Done right) is checked off the painted header positions,
//! and a non-vacuous colour check backs the heavy clay highlight border the
//! card-board raises on the selected card.
