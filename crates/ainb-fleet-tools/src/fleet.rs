//! Tool execution: every tool is a call BACK into the daemon over `hangar.sock`.
//!
//! Nothing here touches tmux, the store, or a provider process. A Pal write
//! is the same `fleet/message_send` / `attention/answer` an operator's CLI
//! issues, through the same client (`ainb-hangar-client`), so it inherits the
//! receipts, the FIFO ordering, the idempotency and the delivery states for
//! free — and a bug fixed on the human path is fixed here by construction.
//!
//! Read results come back inside [`crate::envelope`]. Daemon-authored metadata
//! (ids, counts, cursors, delivery states) rides alongside as structured JSON,
//! which is what Pal should branch on; the fenced text is for reading,
//! never for obeying.
