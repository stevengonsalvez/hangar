//! Read-tool results, fenced as observed data.
//!
//! Every read tool returns text authored by OTHER agents (transcripts, need
//! payloads, session labels) to a Pal that holds write tools. That is the
//! confused-deputy door part 1 already fenced on the re-prime path, arriving
//! through a different one, so it gets the SAME renderer:
//! [`ainb_hangar_proto::reprime`]. One escaping implementation, one set of
//! properties, one place to fix.
//!
//! The only thing added here is a server-authored first line naming the tool.
//! It is built from a `&'static str` in this crate, never from fleet data, so
//! it cannot be forged by anything the envelope carries.
